Don’t worry, you’ll hear from us either way. Here’s what you can expect from the rest of our hiring process:

1.  A phone screen with someone on the hiring team
2.  A brief exercise or homework assignment to assess your skills
3.  A technical interview to discuss your technical knowledge
4.  A culture contribution interview

ConvertKit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms and we hire the best person for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for.

We encourage every person who is interested to apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply. Take the leap - you never know, you might just be the perfect person for one of our open roles, even if you don’t match 100% of the job description
