## Job description

**About Us:**

Kryptos Logic is a boutique cyber security company that provides innovative threat intelligence services to give security conscious organisations the edge to get ahead of security breaches.

We're a remote first company building a scalable victim notification platform to help defend organisations. We love to build things, take them apart, and see how they work. Our projects make use of modern technologies and we follow SOLID design principles.

You may have heard about us previously if you've ever heard of WannaCry, we run and defend the WannaCry kill-switch and find new victims of it every day.

**About The Role:**

We're looking for a Go Developer to join the growing Platform Development team at Kryptos Logic.

You'll join our existing team to help build and grow our capabilities so that we can expand our platform and protect organisations across the world.

You'll be developing and maintaining microservices to supportour platform, enabling customers to easily access their threat intelligence and manage their organisation's threat levels in the best possible ways.Additionally you will beidentifying, designing and implementing internal process improvements such as:automating manual processes, re-designing infrastructure for greater scalability, developing internal bots, and more. We offer a high degree of flexibility and autonomy, and the team collaboratively decides who is best suited to a given task, with the idea being that we play to our strengths.

We work with high volume, and ever-increasing, streaming data. As a result, performance and reliability are critical to our products. We love Go due to it being a simple, performant, languagethat enables us to get going quickly with easy access to powerful concurrency features.We make heavy use oftechnologies such as gRPC and Kafka, but we're a small team that moves quickly -if we identify a technology that's useful to us, we're not afraid to give it a go. As a Go developer on the PlatformDevelopment team, you'll have the opportunity to experiment with and learn about a huge variety of technologies, as well as learn more about the cybersecurity industry.

Don't worry, you don't have to be an expert in everything, and we're happy to hear from people at any stage of their career who are excited by the same things as us. We want to hear from you!
