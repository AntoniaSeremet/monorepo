**About Loom:**

Loom is on a mission to empower everyone at work to communicate more effectively, wherever they are. We are already trusted by over 9M users across 120k+ companies. Our customers are global and use Loom at work at world-class companies including HubSpot, Square, Uber, GrubHub, and LinkedIn.

Founded in 2015, Loom has raised $73 million from top-tier investors including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Coatue, the Slack Fund, and the founders of Instagram, Figma, and Front.

**The Role:**

Loom is looking for an engineer to unify and modernize our marketing tech stack to increase iteration speed and broaden access to top-of-funnel web properties.

We are introducing a new way to communicate with a suite of asynchronous video communication and collaboration tools for the workplace. Communicating the value of Loom is as important as the product itself due to the novelty of the communication medium. You will drive the engineering arm of these efforts, and ensure our systems are scalable and a pleasure to work with for any Loommate.

## Responsibilities:

*   Architect, build, maintain, and document our content infrastructure that is responsible for communicating Loom's identity to the world.
*   Unify all of our online marketing properties to use the same content infrastructure.
*   Adapt our experimentation tooling to support rapid introduction of new experiments for the Marketing and Growth organizations.
*   Prioritize SEO, accessibility (A11y), and internationalization (i18n) to make Loom not only easier to find, but also usable to all those that do find it.
*   Facilitate access and transparency across departments for the tools that you have built.
*   Will ensure the reliability and ease of access to our top of our funnel metrics and track the effects down the analytics pipeline.

## What We're Looking For:

*   2+ years of professional working experience.
*   Solid CSS experience.
*   1+ years of professional ReactJS experience or similar.
*   Significant experience implementing and maintaining a CMS strategy across multiple organizations.
*   Passion for semantic HTML, CSS and accessibility (A11y).
*   Strong UX and design sensibilities and an interest in sweating the small stuff.
*   Passion for rendering performance and responsive web design.
*   Comfort with ambiguity; you enjoy figuring out what needs to be done—and then doing it.
*   Passion and a track record for automating tasks.
*   Excitement to partner with Growth, Marketing, and Design on both large new efforts, as well as small, daily tasks.
*   Nice to have: Contentful, Tailwind CSS, Next.js and Vercel experience.

**Loom = Equal Opportunity Employer:**

We are actively seeking to create a diverse work environment because teams are stronger with different perspectives and experiences.

We value a diverse workplace and encourage women, people of color, LGBTQIA individuals, people with disabilities, members of ethnic minorities, foreign-born residents, older members of society, and others from minority groups and diverse backgrounds to apply. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, religion, color, national origin, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. All employees and contractors of Loom are responsible for maintaining a work culture free from discrimination and harassment by treating others with kindness and respect.
