**About thredUP**

In 2009, thredUP set out to make used clothes the new normal and create a more sustainable future for fashion. The company designed a modern resale experience that took the work and risk out of thrift, and converted a generation of secondhand skeptics to fans. Sellers send clothes directly to thredUP by the bagful, and buyers shop quality-checked items from over 35,000 brands at steep discounts. To power this marketplace, thredUP built an infrastructure that has recirculated 100 million unique garments via proprietary technology, data and logistics. thredUP most recently expanded its platform with Resale-as-a-Service (RaaS) to power resale for the world’s leading fashion brands. As a circular fashion pioneer, thredUP is reducing fashion’s impact on the planet and unlocking economic value for consumers and brands alike.

At thredUP, we’re working to revolutionize the clothing industry and we're looking for a curious and creative Data Scientist to help manage our complex multi-sided marketplace.

If you get excited about data-driven decision making and want to play a role in managing a highly dynamic marketplace, we’d love to hear from you.

*   Develop the algorithms and data strategy that power search and discovery, allowing buyers to seamlessly find items they love in our vast assortment
*   Develop rigorous forecasting systems to bring predictability to our planning around inventory growth and economics
*   Create mathematical representations of the flow of items into and out of our marketplace
*   Drive the strategy for promotions, merchandising campaigns, and sales, and investigate their effect on inventory and buyer mix
*   Participate in our knowledge-sharing culture by spreading best practices and learnings from prior experiences, helping the entire team level up

## Requirements:

*   At least **3 years of full time, professional experience** in data analytics, data science, or software engineering roles
*   Ability to effectively work with business leads; strong cross-functional communication skills that help push projects forward and encourage the development of new collaborations

*   Well-rounded skill set in statistics, machine learning, software development, and project management
*   Advanced knowledge of SQL and Python, and experience writing code in a collaborative environment
*   Prior experience working with marketplaces and/or a relevant background in economics or operations research is a plus
