*   Consult in-depth with defense sector developers who are planning or already using Magic Leap or competing technologies
*   Work with Engineering to design, build, and run proof of concepts with prospective customers
*   Position yourself as a go-to consultative resource and solutions expert for the greater ML Horizons business development team
*   Demonstrate and customize third-party ISV solutions from a variety of sources, working directly with those partners and customers
*   Collaborate with Product, Engineering, and BD teams for optimizing the performance of Magic Leap platform and content running on the platform
*   Communicate with customers for technical support at various phases of adoption
*   Travel to customer or different ML offices, up to 40% working time

## Qualifications

*   5-7+ years of experience in demonstrating and establishing technical feasibility/wins among Enterprise customers
*   Demonstrated track record of customer centric service, consistent on time delivery of custom customer solutions, and team first approach
*   Experience in real-time 3D programming, simulation programming or games middleware with knowledge of real-time rendering and app development process and platforms. Strongly prefer extensive experience in Unity
*   Experience selling or developing solutions along the XR spectrum, from VR to AR
*   Able to present complicated technical concepts in layman’s terms; make the complex simple
*   Experience in “rapid prototyping” of scenarios – show what can be done with simple programming that can later turn into more complicated, enterprise-ready custom solutions
*   Strong problem solving, influencing, conflict resolution and decision-making skills
*   Operate in a fast moving start-up environment
*   Outstanding written and verbal communication skills
*   Energetic and collaborative team player who feeds off of goal setting and achievement
*   A track record of building consensus and delivering high-impact initiatives 
*   Ability to support multiple projects and complex work streams
*   Fearless curiosity, ownership, and accountability

## Education

*    BA/BS from an accredited university or equivalent work experience is required

## Additional Information

*   All your information will be kept confidential according to Equal Employment Opportunities guidelines.

*    This position may have access to ITAR controlled technical data, or material placed under a security classification or similar restriction by the US Government.  As such, this position will require a US Person as defined in the ITAR, and may require the successful completion of a background check for a US Department of Defense security clearance
