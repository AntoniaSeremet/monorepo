## The Opportunity

Modern Tribe is looking for a talented, detail oriented Technical Strategist to join our team. The Technical Strategist’s primary role is to work with our clients to help focus business objectives, develop and interpret project goals, and translate them into executable plans for our teams. This requires a broad understanding of business strategy, software/website development, technology, how it can be used to accomplish objectives, and how that technology will intersect with individuals inside and outside of an organization. The Technical Strategist is one of the primary intersections with our clients – you are a face of our projects.

## Inclusion Statement

Modern Tribe is committed to a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion. We foster an environment of collaboration, open engagement, fairness and respect regardless of differences in age, race, disability, national origin, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status. As a hybrid workspace ranging from distributed contractors to traditional employees, we value the unique perspectives and experiences of our global team.

We come from all walks of life. We are small business owners. We are tattoo aficionados and 80’s movie buffs and ex-pats. We are homeschool teachers. We are single parents. We are musicians, college drop-outs, and entrepreneurs. We are travelers, feminists, runners, volunteers, and makers. We are a Modern Tribe.

Everyday we strive to fulfill our motto: live well and do good work. We hope you will consider joining us.

## What You’ll Do

*   Guide the lifecycle of multiple projects, from inception to launch and beyond. Lead a team of engineers and creatives in sustaining, extending and evolving web and app platforms for high profile clients.
*   Guide and shape project execution. Identify, document and translate requirements into executable plans that adhere to both timeline and budget.
*   Co-own the customer relationship. Alongside with your Producer, steer the client through the project lifecycle and setting expectations.

Above and beyond your individual talents, we’re looking for someone to join our team. We’re a very collaborative bunch, eager for feedback. The work we execute is the product of the team. If you’re excited about learning from others, and helping others – you’ll find a good home here. If that sounds like you, get in touch.

## Knowledge & Experience

Either way, you understand engineering concepts at a level where you have a general idea of how complex tasks are and can competently channel the perspective of engineers who may not be present in the conversation.

*   You are experienced with WordPress. While we work with a number of CMSs, this role will be working with large WordPress multisite networks. You understand how to architect and organize content and data within WordPress.

## Location

Work from anywhere in North, Central or South America. If your timezone is outside of US business hours but you work at least 4+ hours of overlap each day, let's chat. You must be fluent in English. You just need a computer and a a wifi signal to support daily video chats with the Tribe.

## Compensation

This is a freelance contract about 15 – 20 hours per week. Pay range is USD $50-70 per hour commensurate with background, qualifications and experience. We often start our freelancers on a one time contract position (though we are always seeking long standing relationships with awesome people).

## Perks

We believe that distributed working is a way of life. We understand what it means to work remotely. We offer consistency in expectations, payment, and support. We believe in learning from each other and fostering personal growth. You can expect to learn a lot while working with us.

(Also, if you work enough with us, we’ll bring you on the [team trips](https://vimeo.com/254214062).)
