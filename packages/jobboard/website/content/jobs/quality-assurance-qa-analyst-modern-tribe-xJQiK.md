## The Opportunity

Modern Tribe’s QA team works on a lot of cool projects: over the past year alone, we’ve tested sites built by our dev team for big-name clients including [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/), [Bon Appetit Magazine](http://www.foodinnovationgroup.com), [Eventbrite Academy Blog](https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/academy/), [Harvard Law School](http://hls.harvard.edu/) and [Conroe Independent School District](https://www.conroeisd.net/). (Want to see how we did? The links above highlight some of our work).

We’ve got a slew of cool projects we are working on in 2020, and need another member for our QA team. If working on high-profile sites for large clients gets you excited and a serious case of attention to detail is your jam, we should talk.

## Inclusion Statement

Modern Tribe is committed to a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion. We foster an environment of collaboration, open engagement, fairness and respect regardless of differences in age, race, disability, national origin, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status. As a hybrid workspace ranging from distributed contractors to traditional employees, we value the unique perspectives and experiences of our global team.

We come from all walks of life. We are small business owners. We are tattoo aficionados and 80’s movie buffs and ex-pats. We are homeschool teachers. We are single parents. We are musicians, college drop-outs, and entrepreneurs. We are travelers, feminists, runners, volunteers, and makers. We are a Modern Tribe.

Everyday we strive to fulfill our motto: live well and do good work. We hope you will consider joining us.

## Responsibilities

QA is responsible for ensuring all aspects of quality at Modern Tribe. It’s a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionality…it’s a lot of ground to cover. But we’ve got an established workflow down that helps make sure we’re setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.

Though every project is different, here’s the gist of our QA flow:

*   KICKOFF MEETING. Just a kickoff — meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.
*   PREPARING DOCS. Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.
*   REVIEW APPROVED COMPS. Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, you’ll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.
*   QA WALKTHROUGH. Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, you’ll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.
*   PREPARE QA CHECKLIST + TEST PLAN. After seeing each component of the site in action, you’ll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what you’re planning to test, in what order, and when.
*   HEAVY DUTY TESTING. You’ll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, you’ll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what we’re doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.
*   CELEBRATING A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH. What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and — most importantly — the client will be happy. It doesn’t get much better than that.

\* Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.

## Personal Competencies

*   Strong communication and/or experience working as part of a remote team
*   Self-motivated, detail-oriented, a organizational skills, with a methodical approach to all tasks
*   Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines
*   Ability to work independently with minimal oversight
*   Fluent English speaker

## Required Knowledge & Experience

*   Has a proven track record in Quality Assurance.
*   Pays meticulous attention to detail + advocates for the customer. Being able to catch bugs is huge, but it isn’t everything — QA is most effective when it puts itself in the customer or end user’s shoes.
*   Knows WordPress well, you’ll be expected to prove your familiarity with the platform.
*   Excellent verbal, non-verbal and written communication skills
*   Has 1+ year remote freelancing experience.

## Additional Experience (Bonus Points)

*   Familiarity setting up local WordPress environments + cloning GIT repositories locally
*   Skills at training others how to admin complex WordPress sites/projects
*   Experience writing and implementing automated testing processes
