## We want engineers who are passionate about making the internet a better place.

Adzerk is a cloud-based service for building custom ad serving solutions quickly and easily. We are looking for our first Senior Dev/Ops Engineer (with 5-10 years experience) to join our growing team! This is a rare opportunity to be our first Dev/Ops Engineer who will own improvements to our existing structure and own our systems moving forward as we scale to our next level of growth!

What you’ll accomplish: 

*   Develop techniques and practices to better manage platform operations as we continue to scale globally
*   Work with the rest of the engineering team to improve key quality attributes: reduce latency, increase reliability and availability, improve security, etc.
*   Improve deployment automation
*   Monitor AWS costs and drive reduction on an ongoing basis
*   Help diagnose issues when they arise, working with the rest of the team to address them
*   Document and refine incident response process, and lead after incident debriefing
*   Document operational practices and procedures

Skills you’ll bring with you: 

*   Building and/or operating complex distributed systems with a global footprint
*   Diagnosing performance issues in such systems, backed by solid evidence
*   Low-level Linux system administration, e.g., tuning network stacks for performance
*   Amazon Web Services, including EC2, S3, DynamoDB, RDS, Kinesis, EFS, Redshift, SQS and Lambdas.
*   AWS Cost reporting, management and forecasting

You would be a member of an engineering team that values:

*   Constant improvement. If your processes have a way to improve themselves, you’ll never be stuck in a rut. We hold retros, and we value and protect the ability of any team member to say, “This can and should be better.” We value experimentation, especially when coupled with measurement.
*   Balance. We’re a collaborative team. We kick ideas around. The more viewpoints we have, the more likely we are to hear a good idea we haven’t thought of. We all have the opportunity to work on all parts of the system. No one is stuck working on the legacy systems full time.
*   Working to live, not living to work. We take our work seriously. We strive to make the best software we can for our clients. But we know that “release death marches” are not the way to achieve this. Software is a marathon, not a sprint. We work hard, but at a sustainable pace, and do better work as a result.
*   Autonomy. One of our core values as a company is, “We’re all adults.” We do code reviews and sometimes we pair program, but we trust each other. If you thought about the problem and have an opinion, your teammates will listen.
*   Mastery. Our CEO started out as a software engineer. Our VP of Engineering writes Clojure. We have an engineering team with decades of collective experience writing high-quality, fault-tolerant distributed systems. We love taking on and solving hard problems. We love learning.
*   A sense of purpose. We know what problem we’re trying to solve: to provide a first-rate ad serving platform to our global customers while continuing to evolve our product to meet the needs of the future.

## Why you’ll love working with us:

*   You will be part of an inclusive and collaborative team environment where all opinions and values are heard.
*   We are operate remotely. We are a fully distributed team across the US and UK.
*   You’ll receive world class benefits including:

*   100% company paid health, vision, and dental for you and your family.
*   Paid parental leave benefits (12 weeks paid maternity, 4 weeks paid paternity)
*   [Free press benefits](https://artplusmarketing.com/free-press-a-corporate-benefit-that-benefits-all-4f7868f11bbf) 
*   401k (with 4% company match)
*   Unlimited vacation (with total support to take at least 5 consecutive days off per year)
*   8 Paid Holidays + Adzerk Holiday Break (office closed 12/24 - 1/1 every year!)
*   Flexible schedules (you decide when and where you work best)

*   We embrace transparency and encourage you to read more about what we value through our [Company Constitution and Employee Bill of Rights](https://adzerk.com/blog/company-constitution/), our [About Adzerk](https://adzerk.com/about/) page, and [Careers Page](https://adzerk.com/careers/).
