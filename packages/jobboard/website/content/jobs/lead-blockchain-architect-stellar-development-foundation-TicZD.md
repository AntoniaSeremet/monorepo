*   Contribute to the development and implementation of sound crypto-economics
*   Contribute to the positive development of existing and new technology partnerships

## Requirements:

*   You’re compassionate, collaborative, and deeply care for the people around you
*   You know how to engineer elegant products that address the needs of users and businesses while minimizing complexity
