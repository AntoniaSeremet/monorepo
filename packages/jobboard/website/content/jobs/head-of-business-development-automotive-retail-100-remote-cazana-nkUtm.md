## Job description

**About you**

You are an experienced Head of Business Development within the automotive industry. You have been responsible for the management and development of the sales team. Throughout your career, you have been winning business and building relationships along the way and this is where your passion lies.

Your background has been in business development and account management. You are excited and maybe even have experience in joining a relatively small sales function and growing it into something huge and amazing!

Maybe you have hit the ceiling in your current position and the sales team is strong and steady and you have given all you can and you are ready for a fresh, new, exciting challenge.

You are looking for an exciting young company where you can add value but also be given as much as you put in.

If this sounds like you, apply today.

**About the role**

You will be responsible for the management and development of the sales team (business development executives and account managers) for our Retail function.

You will lead by example and roll up your sleeves to win new business and open doors for your team.

This is a brand new position within the company, so we need someone that has been there and done it and can add tremendous value whilst also being ambitious to develop and grow with us as the company grows.

**About us**

Using big data and predictive analytics, Cazana analyses millions of automotive transactions daily to assess the value and risk associated with every vehicle on the road, enabling more accurate valuation and pricing in vehicle purchasing and insuring. We aim to make the car market (across all its service lines) fairer through a wholesale modernisation in its approach to pricing.

Founded in 2013, we are disrupting an industry which has typically been associated with mistrust due to the lack of accurate data. We use innovative AI and data-science driven modelling in a sector that can feel dated and we have developed the industry’s first real-time retail-driven valuations. Our systems are used by insurers, dealerships, finance companies and manufacturers globally.

Our mission is to set the world standard in automotive data. We create a fairer market for all by embedding unique data and accurate insight into automotive businesses globally:

*   Fairer to insurers: Avoid fraud. Price every policy correctly
*   Fairer to policyholders: Pay the right premium. Have claims settled fairly and fast.
*   Fairer to the planet: Make electric vehicles and new fuel types accessible to all with accurate future values enabling finance and subscription business models
*   Fairer to lenders: Lend based on fact, not anecdotes to reduce risk.
*   Fairer to dealers: Stock the right vehicles. Achieve a fair price for them all.

**What do you get (remuneration & benefits)?**

*   Competitive base salary (disclosed at first stage screening)
*   All the equipment you need to get the job done
*   The ability to work where and when you want in order to get the job done (remote and flexible working welcome)
*   A central London office and meeting space to use when you need it
*   Access to free counselling, therapy and mental health support via [Spill](https://www.spill.chat/)
*   Access to free personal/ professional coaching via a trained internal coach
*   Cycle to work scheme
*   25 days holiday, all bank holidays off and any period of closure over Christmas also paid.
*   Learning and training supported
*   Ability to make your mark on a fast-growing start-up that is disrupting a huge (£34Bn annual) industry.

## Job requirements

**The skills, attributes and experience you must have:**

*   Experience as a Head of Business Development, ideally in a retail function
*   Strong leadership and management skills
*   Sharing best practice and coaching principles
*   Passion for sales and account growth
*   Experience leading and managing a sales team
*   Motivated and ambitious
*   Approachable, no ego
*   Hands-on first, lead by example
*   Automotive industry experience (this would be nice to have)

**Our application process**

We want to make sure we hire the best available talent! We had a fantastic 2020 with all of our hires hitting the ground running. We are excited to do the same in 2021.

Every role is crucial to us at this stage of our growth. We are improving and evolving our recruitment and application process on a monthly basis. We are trying to remove any bias from our recruitment process, this is an on-going issue in the recruitment function for companies of all sizes.

To help achieve this we have refined our application form that you will find when you click 'Apply for this job'. The answers to the questions are the difference between your application being progressed or not so please do give them your time and effort when answering. The first thing our Talent Partner will review is these questions (we may not even need to review your CV depending on your answers).

Good luck with your application and thank you in advance for your interest in joining us at Cazana.
