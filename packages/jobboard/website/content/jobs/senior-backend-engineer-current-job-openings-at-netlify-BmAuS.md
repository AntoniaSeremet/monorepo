## Company Overview

At [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/about/), we're building a platform to empower digital designers and developers to build better, more elaborate web projects than ever before. We're aiming to change the landscape of modern web development.

We recently raised $53M in Series C funding to bring forward the next generation of tooling for a more accessible web. This round was led by the EQT Ventures with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz & Kleiner Perkins. This brings Netlify’s funding raised in total to $97M to date. Other past investors include Bloomberg Beta, Designer Fund, and Tank Hill Ventures, as well as the founders of Figma, GitHub, Slack and Yelp.

Netlify is a diverse group of incredible talent from all over the world. We’re ~48% woman or non-binary, and are composed of about half as many nationalities as we are team members.

## About the Opportunity:

At Netlify, we’re building a system that supports millions of customer sites, processing over a petabyte of data and serving over 8% of the internet’s traffic. With our team, we truly empower our engineers through an autonomous pod-based model that allows our teams to own various stages of the customer journey. We’ve been remote-first since our inception and are globally distributed, spanning across North America, Europe, and Africa. We’re biased towards asynchronous planning and communication, meaning less meetings and more execution. We take documentation seriously and place our values of transparency, empowerment, and commitment at the forefront of everything we do. We’re driven by passion and we make sure that everyone on the team knows their value, feels ownership over their work, and can quickly see the impact of their efforts. Beyond just hiring smart, empathetic team members, we foster a culture where there are no dumb questions and our team can get access to the resources that they need to continue to learn. As a remote-first company, diversity drives our identity. Whether you’re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Netlify is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life.

As a Backend Engineer at Netlify, you'll work with a smart set of team members who are very motivated to keep learning and continuing to grow each other in a supportive way. We have a blameless culture where we solve problems as a team and everyone works together towards a common goal. There are different backend-oriented teams that your interests and experience could lead you into.

With our Observability team, your mission is to help our customers monitor and troubleshoot their apps, and evaluate their health and performance when exposed to real user traffic. You’ll be working with large amounts of streaming data, using a variety of technologies to process and store this data, providing our customers valuable information about their apps. If you're excited about working with Go, Kafka, and Clickhouse, among other technologies, you'll have plenty of opportunities to do so with our team. The team ships changes several times a day, so you’ll quickly see the impact of your work.

With our Runtime & Integrated Apps team, your mission is to design and implement fault-tolerant distributed systems and create the supporting features that they leverage. You’ll be working across a variety of technologies to solve problems around the massive traffic that we receive on the platform, so if you're excited about working in complex Go or Rust code, you'll have plenty of opportunities to do so with our team! The platform is at the core of Netlify, where you'll be developing software that powers the lifecycle of a web request, enables developers to interact with the edge, and strives for better availability and higher throughput. This includes functionality like Edge Lambda invocation, caching & invalidation, request rules, pre-rendering, and logging aggregation. The platform is built on top of 6 different cloud providers and is truly global, supporting constant traffic from all over the world. We move quickly and adjust to changing priorities and conditions, and you'll be able to help us focus on key priorities and pragmatic solutions.
