Auth0 is a unicorn that just closed a $120M Series F round of funding, with total capital raised to date of $330M and valuation of nearly $2B. We are growing rapidly and looking for exceptional new team members to add to our exceptional talent pool - and who will help take us to the next level of success. One team, one score. 

Our vision is to provide people with secure access to any application in one click or less. And our promise is to make identity work for everyone—whether you’re a developer looking to innovate, or a security professional looking to mitigate. We are looking for curious, excited, boundary-pushing team members. So, if you’re a big thinker who is nimble and adaptable, Auth0 may be an ideal place for you to shine.

As a **Platform Engineer** on the Marketing organization in Auth0, you will create, maintain and improve the software foundations of the whole marketing team, enabling us to efficiently test ideas, scale our delivery or provide new capabilities internally and externally. 

The team is built around three themes or overarching initiatives: 1) Developer Experience, 2) Operations and 3) Observability.  Developer Experience talks about the ease of use, scalability and maintainability of our systems, thus providing speed to our development process through the right tools. Operations is about the availability, fast access and the resilience of our systems. And Observability is around providing the channels and frameworks required to know the current and historical status of our systems.

This role can be based from a home office anywhere in the US, Canada or Buenos Aires.
