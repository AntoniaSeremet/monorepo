## Description

At Nixa.io, we are on a global mission to change both _how_ and _where_ companies recruit technical talent. In fact, we want to flip the whole traditional model of recruitment. It doesn’t fit the needs of innovative and fast-growing businesses today. We are on a mission to solve two of the most common challenges of tech recruitment, the unequal distribution of talent, and the increasing time to hire across the globe.

**We are solving these challenges by introducing an automated and self-service recruitment platform that enables a permanent remote hire in 2 weeks.**

Nixa.io is an innovative curated job platform connecting companies with software engineers who are actively searching for permanent remote opportunities. Our technology makes it possible to reduce the time to hire from an average of 5 months in Europe to just 2 weeks. Nixa.io offers companies access to pre-vetted talents within 48 hours and facilitates a permanent hire faster than any competitor. We specialize in remote hiring to fill permanent needs, which is totally unique in Europe today.

Nixa.io is led by pioneers and thought leaders within the recruitment sector and we’re backed by industry experienced founders and investors. We're a team of 7 people working remotely across Norway, Poland, and Romania. All of the co-founders have an excellent track record within the recruitment industry and have previously built and scaled multiple companies.

Right now, we're an early-phase start-up with a huge potential in the fast-growing remote job market. We’ve actively been testing the platform for the last 12 months, and we’re already working with and hiring for global companies. Our ambitions are global and we’re now in a position to scale Nixa.io in an international market.

To accomplish our growth successfully, we’re in need of an extraordinary business developer to join our growth team. This is an opportunity to influence and participate in an early phase startup on a mission to disrupt traditional tech recruitment. It’s also a unique opportunity to get lots of responsibility early in your career.

We’re extremely proud of the work we do and it all boils down to the talented and dedicated people who make up the Nixa.io team. Do you want to be part of it?
