Over a million designers use Sketch to transform their ideas into incredible products every day. Want to join us and help us take our accounting operations to the next level? We’re looking for our second hire on the accounting team.

**The job**

As an accountant at Sketch, your focus will be scaling accounting operations, writing and implementing accounting policies in accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS), and ensuring financial and tax compliance.

**The challenge**

2021 is going to be a very exciting year at Sketch. Our business and team are growing fast and there is a huge amount of opportunity.

In the coming months, we’ll launch major new features while improving our internal processes and incorporating new tools and technology, in order to give our customers (external and internal) the level of service they deserve. It’s an exciting time to join Sketch, and this is a great opportunity for someone looking for a new adventure — as well as personal and professional development.

As Accounting, our main task is to accurately report the financial health of the business. The exciting part, we're responsible for so much. Additional responsibilities are providing accurate and complete data to executives for them to make informed decisions; and building out our operations infrastructure with new systems, process and policies - so as to keep friction out of the business and help us scale.

We are a remote company, which has plenty of advantages — though it can be a challenge to keep up with our rhythm. Don’t worry though — we’ll help you, and you’ll feel like part of the team in no time.

**About you**

Passionate about the details, but able to appreciate and be accountable for big picture goals.

Operational excellence is in your DNA.

A strong, foundational understanding of IFRS and willingness to research, apply, and communicate policies to Sketch's business.

Communicate transparently and concisely with management as well as other members of the operations team.

You’re looking for a new adventure and want to feel that what you do is meaningful both for you and for others. You’re a team player who’s willing to work in a fast-paced environment with shifting procedures.

**About Sketch**

Sketch is a 100% remote company, and your colleagues are distributed around the globe. Being remote adds great flexibility, and helps us build a more diverse team. We put respect for each other above everything else.

Besides being remote, we work asynchronously as often as we can. This means that our team communicates mostly using Slack. When we need it, we also have video calls.

The role will report to the Director of Accounting and will work closely with the greater operations team as well as the third party providers assisting in our day to day. We work on everything from accounting operations, to tax, to compliance, to financial planning.
