## Job description

**About you**

You’re an experienced product owner with energy in spades. You know how to manage the full product lifecycle and relish the full scope of getting involved in strategy, all the way through to being hands-on and doing.

You are passionate about taking a data-driven approach to product development and are fluent in creating and using metrics in your decision making and success tracking. Able to work closely with technical teams and senior managers alike, you are used to acting as the lynchpin that brings together the different teams in order to get a product delivered.

Ruthlessly self-organised, driven and a doer, you are known as being reliable. People enjoy working with you, as you get things done, and elevate the offering through a combination of skill, energy and will.

In short, you are good at what you do and love doing it. You may be in a role where it seems like there is no progression or development available to you, and you are looking for your next adventure. You want to be a part of something at the beginning of an exciting growth phase, and you are looking to take the product lead on that journey.

You want to work as part of a senior leadership team, but predominantly want to stay hands-on in a standalone role, like this, you realise, is where the magic happens.

And who knows, you may even be a lover of classic cars! ☺ (no probs if you’re not, we just know there are a lot of you out there)

**About the role**

This is a senior leadership role with Car & Classic. Working closely with the Director of Engineering, the Head of Sales, Head of Growth and the COO, you will be a key figure in the ongoing growth and journey we are on.

It is a standalone product management role, meaning you will be delivering on the nuts and bolts of product management, as well as strategizing on the product direction. People who like to do just strategy and think need not apply, as there is decent work to be done creating and embedding solid product management practices alongside our awesome Director of Engineering. Day to day you’ll own the product strategy, roadmap & specifications, regularly switching between long term strategy & day to day operations.

You will also be able to tap into the awesome Product resource within Cazana, having a line of communication into the Chief Product Officer there to empower you to deliver above and beyond your standalone remit, as well as get crucial personal development. This is a complementary part of the role, however, and it is important to be clear that you will remain the lead on all things product in Car & Classic.

**About us [https://www.carandclassic.co.uk/](https://www.carandclassic.co.uk/)**

**Reporting line**

You will be reporting into the COO, however, will be expected to be fully autonomous and self-managing. This is a stand-alone role that will require your initiative and leadership, so you will be expected to take charge of your own role, performance, reporting and results. Chris will be there to approve your holidays, make sure you are doing ok, help you where you need and just show you the love. ☺
