It’s an exciting time to join Magic Leap’s People and Transformation function.  This newly created role will be a critical part of how we enable our Talent Acquisition team to drive and influence Magic Leap’s focus on diversity and inclusion. 

As a Diversity Sourcer, you’ll collaborate across the company, including senior leaders, our People and Transformation Team, our Talent Acquisition Team, and our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Project Manager, to develop and execute on a DE&I-focused hiring strategy.

## What you’ll do:

*   Source candidates for a variety of roles (e.g., product manager, UX researcher, software engineer) from diverse talent pools 
*   Develop, update, and maintain diverse sourcing relationships and materials (e.g. list of diverse talent sources, prioritized schools, interview guides, evaluation rubrics)
*   Analyze diversity data to understand, identify and prioritize areas of focus for TA 
*   Define, track, and maintain KPIs related to diversity hiring (e.g. diverse slates, panels etc.) in partnership with HR and Legal
*   Manage the hiring lifecycle, including communicating with and providing support to a diverse set of candidates while infusing inclusive practices each step of the way
*   Evaluate existing hiring tools and processes for bias, and identify alternative tools or enact changes to minimize bias 
*   Continually keep abreast and drive the adoption of emerging best practices for DE&I-focusing hiring 
*   Build relationships with diversity-focused organizations 
*   Partner with Magic Leap’s internal Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Project Manager 

## What we’re looking for: 

*   Experience sourcing for a variety of technology-related roles 
*   Experience sourcing for and working with a wide range of underrepresented groups
*   Experience working with remote teams 
*   Knowledge of core DE&I concepts and best practices in DE&I recruitment and hiring 
*   Demonstrated record of advancing equity and inclusion within or outside the workplace (e.g., work experience, participation in DE&I organizations, volunteerism) 
*   A mindset and work approach that aligns with our core values (Unity, User-Centricity, Innovation)
