**The Role:**

We’re looking to add a Senior Data Engineer to our growing Data team to help us build the data foundation that will enable data science and analytics to derive insights and build models that will unlock the next stage of Loom’s growth.  

You will be collaborating with the data team, engineering team & stakeholders across the company to build the foundation of our data infrastructure. You will take ownership of the transformation layer from raw data to the models that drive all critical analysis and dashboards across the organization.

*   Develop testing and monitoring across the transformation layer to ensure data quality from raw sources and all models downstream.
*   Build out documentation that supports code maintainability and ultimately a Data Dictionary that makes data accessible to the whole company.  

## What We're Looking For:

*   5+ years experience in a data engineering or data science role
*   Strong communication skills to work with stakeholders to translate business needs and ideas into tractable technical work items.
