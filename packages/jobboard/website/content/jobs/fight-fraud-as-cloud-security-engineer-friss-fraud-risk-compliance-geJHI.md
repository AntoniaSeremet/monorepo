## Your mission as a Cloud Security Engineer @ FRISS

You make sure that the products we develop and the infrastructure we use, are secure (by design) and compliant with existing laws and regulations. You will challenge and help our developers and DevOps engineers in making the right choices. In other words, you make sure that Security is shift to the left. As well as having shared responsibility with your fellow Security Officers: sometimes you will be client-facing and help them understand our security proposition and design.

In a typical week, you will deal with areas such as Application Security, Infrastructure designs and Architecture design questions. Youâ€™ll sit together with Product Owners in their Agile sessions and make sure the right considerations and requirements are discussed when backlog items are created. To deal with such areas, we expect you to be experienced in at least the majority of topics such as: Authentication (i.e. OIDC), Encryption and Cloud Security.

In a nutshell, this is a diverse role in which you will work together closely with your team members to get to the best results.
