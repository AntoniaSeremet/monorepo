## Description

**Why?**

With so many companies transitioning to remote work, what we offer is more relevant than ever, and we are growing fast! We need someone who can onboard our rapidly growing client base across USA.

**What?**

You will take on the role of Customer Experience Coordinator and you’ll be the second Customer Success hire in the region so this is a great time to come and help shape our processes, deliver tangible results, and delight our customers.

**Who?**

You’re not only able to articulate complex ideas in a simple way for our customers, you are obsessed with simplifying (and building) internal processes too, always putting the voice of the customer first.

**The detail**

**About Omnipresent**

Remote work is one of the great equalisers of our time, allowing people to secure employment opportunities from companies around the world, no matter where they were born or where they live.

Yet, at a time when remote work is exploding, most companies are finding it too complex, costly and time consuming to employ workers internationally. At Omnipresent, we’re cutting this complexity and providing our clients, and their remote workers, with a simplified, cost effective and legally compliant employment experience. With a network of legal entities across the world, coupled with an automation-focused tech platform, we’re building the premier global employment-as-a-service offering on the market.

**Your role**

At Omnipresent, you will shape positive customer outcomes through effective, proactive interactions. You will also be tasked to collect and analyze data and feedback in order to develop more expedient processes and improve our valued customers’ perceptions on the entire service experience. You’ll be involved in all aspects of customer interactions, end-to-end support, account management, guiding and educating customers and more. Additionally, all team members will look to you and the Customer Success team for input across key decisions.

*   Loves to solve complex operational issues by building simple processes, identifying and using modern (online) solutions to ensure a maximum degree of automation, replacing manual human interaction wherever possible

**What’s in it for you (apart from the most fun and challenging ride of your life!)**

*   Shared ownership - Being a part of our journey means you will own a piece of Omnipresent
*   Annual vacation entitlement: 33 days including local holidays

_We believe remote working is a great equaliser and we practice what we preach. Inclusivity is fundamental to our mission and we are committed to conscious inclusion. We believe in the potential of everyone; regardless of race, religion or belief, ethnic origin, different physical ability, family structure, socio-economics, age, nationality or citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, or gender identity._
