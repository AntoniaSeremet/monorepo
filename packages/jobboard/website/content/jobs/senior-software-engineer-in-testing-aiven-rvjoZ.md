You’ll be part of a team working on the Aiven cloud platform, further extending the test automation, test infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline, focusing on more complicated scenarios, like performance testing and upgrade tests.

We offer and operate a number of complex open source databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL and Apache Cassandra as well as other open source data technologies like Apache Kafka.
