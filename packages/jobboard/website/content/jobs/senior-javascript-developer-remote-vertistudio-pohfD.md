## About us

We're a friendly group of designers, developers, testers, and marketers having a great time building themes at ThemeIsle, sharing the best content at CodeinWP, and straight-up innovating with Optimole.

## Our mission

Make it easy for anyone in the world to launch & grow their online presence, through education, high-quality products, and reliable support.

## About the role

We’re looking for a Senior JavaScript Developer that will join the engineering team. You will design, implement, document, and maintain front-end systems for multiple high-traffic applications.

We have an ongoing need for front-end developers who are experienced in the Gutenberg editor for WordPress. You would need to be able to use WordPress Gutenberg to build out blocks for projects, coding natively with Gutenberg using JS and React and PHP.

## Requirements

Note: it is not required that you have all of these! Teams have varying needs, focuses, and use varying technologies.

*   BA/BS in Computer Science or equivalent
*   Minimum of 2+ years experience building web applications
*   Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
*   Understanding of responsive design and its implementation
*   Experience building and shipping production React.js applications
*   Extensive knowledge of the JavaScript ecosystem
*   Ability to work in cross-functional teams
*   Good analytical and debugging skills
*   Unit/integration testing experience
*   Experience working with and/or designing RESTful APIs
*   Working knowledge of internationalization, localization, and/or accessibility
*   Expertise with WordPress

## Who you are?

*   You’re independent, take initiative often, and come up with your own ideas. Being entirely responsible for a project – from start to finish – doesn't scare you.
*   You're a great communicator and have excellent levels of English, both spoken and written. In our company, communication is key.
*   You are curious and keen to learn new things. Developing new skills is one of your main goals.
*   You love to add value and get deeply involved in everything you're building. You always try to deliver the best possible product.
*   You enjoy working in a team and helping other developers.
*   You use feedback to improve yourself and do not see it as a personal criticism.    
*   You don't mind taking care of tasks of all sizes – from bug fixes to large features.
