Revieve is a market-leading beauty-technology company partnered with 70+ global brands on 4 continents building the new standard of commerce across skin, beauty, health and wellness. We enable brands and retailers to drive their customer-experience leveraging AI, AR and Computer-Vision. We've been fortunate to partner with world-leading brands including ULTA, Shiseido, Unilever and others to drive business results.

## Who are we looking for?

As the global industry leader, we're looking for new Directors of Business Development to help us expand our presence in the APAC region and Japan. Working as a key member of our Sales team, you'll be responsible to lead the growth of the company in the region.

You have 3+ years of experience with enterprise sales in SaaS, Retail, Software or Tech direct selling and know what it's like to work in a fast-growing company. You are a strategic deal closer with a strong bias for action and high integrity. You are technically capable, ambitious, articulate and curious. Confident, yet humble you impress with the substance you bring to the table.

Since we’re a geographically distributed team, we expect you to be a great communicator and an absolute team player. Fluent English is a must as well as either Chinese or Japanese.

The position location is flexible. Preferred locations are major cities.

## Who are we?

We’re a group of creative minds and growth-minded action-takers. We’re proud of the work we do and inspired by the people we work with. Although we are organized in different departments, many of us wear multiple hats and thrive in the ability to learn new things and grow, both professionally as well as personally.

We’re inherently global with a diverse team of about 40 people representing 19 nationalities across 4 continents and 8 different time zones.

## So what's the deal?

We’re leading the next generation of personalized experiences in Health, Beauty and Wellness commerce and we want you on it. We guarantee it will be challenging, but rewarding beyond imagination. We’re offering an active part in a truly transformative, market-leading tech firm with an international atmosphere, not to mention a competitive compensation package and great perks.

If you join us, you'll be able to enjoy being part of a fast-paced environment where we get stuff done and are fully aligned on a shared vision.

Intrigued? We look forward to hearing from you!
