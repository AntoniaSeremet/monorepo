## About the Company

Pressable is a WordPress hosting and digital experience platform. We were founded in 2010 with one goal in mind: to empower site owners to focus on building their sites instead of dealing with technical issues. We accomplished this by providing world-class managed WordPress hosting, fast/reliable servers, and an easy to use panel that tied it all together, all backed by five-star-rated support. 

The company rebranded in 2013 and began working more closely with developers, [agencies](https://pressable.com/managed-wordpress-hosting-for-agencies/), and [ecommerce](https://pressable.com/woocommerce/) site owners. 

Following the acquisition by Automattic (the parent company of WordPress.com, WooCommerce, Tumblr and others), the architecture behind Pressable was rebuilt from the ground up, resulting in industry accolades for speed, reliability, and service. 

Now, a once small South Texas tech company has become a worldwide hosting platform that serves startups and Fortune 1000 companies alike. But one thing hasn’t changed from our humble roots: the goal to provide world-class managed WordPress hosting backed by award-winning customer support.

## Background

Pressable was founded with the mantra “Focus on your content, not your content management system”. 

As a distributed company, we all work from the location of our choice. We care about the work we produce, not just the hours we put in.

Our platform improves WordPress with developer tools, cloud management, security, and analytics, so that companies can build and deploy their digital experiences faster than ever. 

Team members are curious, driven, compassionate, tenacious, autonomous, friendly, independent, collaborative, communicative, supportive, self-motivated, and amazing with .gifs!

Come work with people interested in making the web and the world a better place!
