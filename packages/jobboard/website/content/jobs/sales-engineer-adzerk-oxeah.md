Adzerk enables our customers to build innovative and relevant advertising and content experiences quickly and easily. The Adzerk Sales Engineer is a vital member of our sales team that works to delight prospective customers and their integrating engineers. They are effective communicators who can pivot with ease — from discussing targeting options and GDPR with a CEO, to the latest javascript framework or the latency involved with making requests from Google Cloud to AWS with a developer. They should be comfortable sketching out ad request / API workflows on a whiteboard, and delivering a product demo to a crowded room. 

## The successful candidate will:

*   Have prior experience working with REST APIs and a highly technical product. 
*   Be high-energy, passionate and creative. 
*   Be an exceptional communicator and presenter, comfortable speaking in groups, being recorded and speaking with both technical and non-technical audiences. 
*   Research, Test, Ask. A successful solutions architect will always search for a solution, try it, and finally ask for help. An independent problem solver will find the most success. 

## The exceptional candidate will:

*   Have previous coding experience in some form. While you won’t need to write any code of your own, you should be able to write JSON and understand basic code. 
*   Have experience working with tools like Postman, Datadog and Papertrail.
*   Have previous experience working in adtech. 
*   Have previous experience working remotely. 

## You will: 

*   Become an expert in Adzerk, our APIs, and what they can do. 
*   Work closely with Adzerk’s Sales team to develop and deliver technical demonstrations and answer technical questions during the sales process. 
*   Troubleshoot customer problems while they are building, and keep sales execs and sales leadership up to date on development progress.
*   Assist in the completion of customer RFPs and security/infrastructure questionnaires. 
*   Own and drive relationships with technical audiences of all kinds, from integrating engineers to CTOs, understanding business objectives and explaining solutions. 
*   Capture feedback for product and engineering, and advocate internally on prospect and customer’s behalf.
