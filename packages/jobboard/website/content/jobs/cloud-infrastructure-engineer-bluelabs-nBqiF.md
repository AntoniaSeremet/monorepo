After a period of experimentation, we are now excited to see our technology powering the launch of a new B2C operator in Ghana in early 2021.

To ensure the continuous enhancement of our platform while scaling up operations and entering additional African countries we are now looking to enlarge our team. As a result, our Infrastructure Team is now on the lookout for an Infrastructure Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.

*   Deploying services or designing processes to support the needs of other engineering teams.
*   Defining what our infrastructure might look like in the near future.
*   Preparing a backup and disaster recovery strategy to keep our data safe and minimise the RTO.
*   Writing code to automate processes and deploy new cloud services/resources.
*   Maintaining the core infrastructure of the company.
*   Working with other engineering teams to troubleshoot and resolve operational issues.
