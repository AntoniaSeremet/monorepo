**What is Pathrise?**

[Pathrise](https://www.pathrise.com/) (YC W18) is an online program for tech professionals that provides 1-on-1 mentorship, training and advice to help anyone land their next job. On top of that, we're built around aligned incentives. Fellows only pay when they get hired and start working at a job first.

Every day we are expanding our team and our services. We are looking for individuals who are ready to jump into a new role with us. We are a flourishing team and we really enjoy working together to improve our fellows chances of getting the jobs of their dreams!  If this sounds like something you'd be interested we’d like the opportunity to get to know you more.

**Our Mission**

We seek to uplift job seekers in their careers and help them fulfill their hopes, ambitions, and livelihoods. Read more about why we’re driven to do this in our [manifesto](https://www.pathrise.com/manifesto).

In addition to fostering career growth for individuals, Pathrise has 3x YoY growth with an 98% placement rate and with expanding tracks in various industries. Pathrise is positioned to grow even more in 2020! With over 500 fellows placed everywhere from FB, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Uber to startups we are looking to expand our team in the Software Engineering space.

As a part time software engineering mentor, you will be responsible for fellow success by helping them develop their technical interviewing skills through a variety of online sessions. You will work cross-functionally with our career and software engineering mentors to provide up-to-date, relevant information to help our fellows not only pass interviews but gain confidence in their abilities!

*   Work alongside Pathrise Mentors and learn how to best meet the needs and learning styles of your fellows
*   Guide fellows through both technical and behavioral aspects of the job search, such as Algorithm / Data Structure interviews, discussing technical accomplishments of their backgrounds, and more
*   Facilitate a thoughtful and inclusive environment for all fellows to learn and grow in their technical skills to achieve great results and land the job of their dreams!

*   Adept at giving code reviews

## Pathrise Values...

*   **your work-life-balance:** we are a start-up and we do work hard but we also know the balance between working hard and burning out. We value our employees and that’s why we have these added employee benefits: an employee wellness stipend, unlimited paid-time-off and remote work or flexible work is available for most positions.
*   **growing employees:** we value giving and receiving feedback (constructively) and we value continuous improvement. We want you to grow professionally and we include a professional development stipend to help you achieve that. 
*   **diversity, equity and inclusion:** we value people, opinions and thoughts from diverse backgrounds. Our culture is built upon the pillar of ‘DEI is _not a separate_ initiative from Pathrise it _is a part_ of Pathrise.’ We invite all to share their stories and we believe that it is through acceptance and curiosity that we can create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace.

## What’s in it for You?

*   Be a mentor to individuals who want to break into or accelerate their career in the SWE space
*   Build relationships with fellows and really make a difference to their careers and lives!
*   Flexible schedule and remote work 
*   Be a part of a really fun and mission driven organization!
