At Forestry.io, we believe the web is one of humanity’s greatest achievements and our mission is to help people build a better web. We’re building a Git-backed content management system (CMS) and an open source site-editing toolkit ([TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org/)), both focused on the JAMstack. [We’re a growing company](https://forestry.io/about) with big dreams that's full of opportunities for you to have an impact and grow with us.

We are looking for a Sales Development Representative (SDR) to join our sales team. This is a great opportunity to be the second sales hire within a fast-growing business as you jump-start your career. As an SDR, you’ll be developing your core sales skills while working cross-functionally on projects that will contribute to the long-term success of the company.

Your main focus will be helping our potential customer understand Forestry’s value proposition by working both inbound and outbound leads. You’ll be responsible for generating new business opportunities for the sales team.

## What You'll Do:

*   You will execute the top of the funnel processes for Forestry’s inbound leads. 
*   You will source qualified contacts in our target accounts by using our persona guidelines.
*   You will help create and foster a consultative, customer-first SDR culture that embraces creating lasting relationships with customers.
*   You will learn how to leverage and develop proficiency with sales tools (HubSpot, ZoomInfo, etc.) to manage sales processes. 
*   You will collaborate closely with our Head of Sales and Solutions Engineering team to help build the culture and processes of our sales team.

## Who You Are:

*   You have excellent communication, organizational, and time management skills.
*   You strive to exceed your goals, and love the challenge of working in a fast-paced environment. 
*   You’re open, honest and love to learn.
*   You’re excited about technology, and you want to join a high-growth startup.

## Nice-To-Haves:

*   **6+ months of previous SDR experience**
