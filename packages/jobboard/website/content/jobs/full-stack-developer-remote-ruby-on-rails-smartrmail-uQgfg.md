## Description

We're looking for a remote Full Stack Developer (Ruby on Rails / Vue.js) to join our team to help grow our start-up [SmartrMail](https://www.smartrmail.com/) and improve email marketing for commerce. Come join us building the highest rated marketing app on Shopify!

## About SmartrMail üìß

The standard in email marketing sucks, especially for commerce. As a merchant, you're either stuck with a basic platform that sends bulk newsletters your customers hate, or you can upgrade to an enterprise tool which you pay too much for and will never have time to properly configure.SmartrMail is the easiest and quickest way to implement a powerful email marketing strategy for commerce. Within minutes merchants have a template that matches their site, automations tailored to their customers journeys, and recommendations with products based on customer data. This saves merchants' valuable time, delights their customers, and grows their business.We have 300+ ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è reviews and a 4.9/5 rating on Shopify, the highest of all email marketing apps.
