**What is Pathrise?**

[Pathrise](https://www.pathrise.com/) (YC W18) is an online program for tech professionals that provides 1-on-1 mentorship, training and advice to help anyone land their next job. On top of that, we're built around aligned incentives. Fellows only pay when they get hired and start working at a job first.

Every day we are expanding our team and our services. We are looking for individuals who are ready to jump into a new role with us. We are a flourishing team and we really enjoy working together to improve our fellows chances of getting the jobs of their dreams!  If this sounds like something you'd be interested we’d like the opportunity to get to know you more.

**Our Mission**

We seek to uplift job seekers in their careers and help them fulfill their hopes, ambitions, and livelihoods. Read more about why we’re driven to do this in our [manifesto](https://www.pathrise.com/manifesto).

We’re looking to expand our **Software Engineering Track** to build out our admission support and help shape the next iteration of the Pathrise program. This role will involve a high level of experimentation and flexibility. Some work on weekends and evenings is expected and the role is fully remote.

As an **Admissions Specialist**, you will be responsible for overseeing Pathrise's admission process. You will give technical assessments to prospective fellows to assess their technical coding abilities along with other metrics we value from fellows. You will also have the chance to help our job seekers develop their technical interviewing skills through a variety of online sessions. You will work cross-functionally with SWE Industry Leads, our product team, and operations to promote engagement, process improvements, and data tracking.

We are looking for an Admissions Specialist to have:

**Strong communication skills:** You can communicate high quality feedback in technical interviews to help improve the experience for Pathrise candidates. You have knack of communicating the value that Pathrise offers to help candidates understand the benefit of the program.

**Able to learn on the fly:** You are a quick, relentless, and versatile learner who is open to change. You like to experiment and will try anything to find solutions. You are technically savvy and a natural sales person (or with a strong passion to learn about sales techniques).

**An adept collaborator:** You are able to collaborate remotely, with team members and managers in different locations. You can quickly find common ground and solve problems for the good of all. You are a team player who can solve problems with peers with a minimum of noise.

**Action-oriented:** You enjoy working hard and confront challenges with enthusiasm. You can set goals, prioritize the next steps to achieve them, and measure your success/impact.
