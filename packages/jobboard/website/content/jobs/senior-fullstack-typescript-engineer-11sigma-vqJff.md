Hi! My name is Chris, I’m the CEO of [11Sigma](https://11sigma.com/), and I’d like to invite you to join our team.

We started 11Sigma in 2018 with a vision of a world of opportunities and the freedom enabled by remote work.

We believe that remote work is a lifestyle, it’s about the culture, values, and mindset, not a “corporate benefit” or a “post-COVID reality”.

Our three values: explore, be free, and contribute define who we are, and what we do.

Our dream is to build a company open to everyone, which supports you in experiencing an exciting, fulfilling life.

11Sigma is about exploring. Both literal, as in a journey, as well as open-mindedness, self-growth, and curiosity of life and at work.

We are software engineers, travelers, digital nomads, caring parents, adventurers. We are internally-motivated problem solvers and contributors.

To us, life is an adventure, and the world is incredibly interesting. We are hungry to learn new things and explore our potential.

To find exciting work and open amazing opportunities we partner with tech startups that build incredible products and provide a healthy work-life balance.

If the above resonates with you, please read on.
