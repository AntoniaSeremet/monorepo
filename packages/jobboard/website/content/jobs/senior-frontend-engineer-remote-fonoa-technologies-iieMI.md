You will work on the **entire lifecycle of a product**. You will have to understand the customer need, currently available solutions in the market, why are they suboptimal and how can we create a superior product.

You will have to **think about how to solve a problem** by optimizing for the best customer experience and navigating towards business goals.

You will work closely with your product counterpart on designing the product, defining the specs, working on the code, ensuring it's properly tested and deployed.

You will be given a lot of **autonomy, trust, and independence** to improve every aspect of our product.

We are solving one of the largest yet unsolved problems in global e-commerce and looking for developers with a hunger for a new challenge and drive to solve a ubiquitous problem for companies selling globally.

*   Internalize and understand customers’ needs and propose ideas and discuss solutions collaborating with the team on engineering, product & design
*   Implement best practices in terms of accessibility and compatibility with cross-device and cross-browser features

## Benefits

*   A very competitive compensation package including equity
