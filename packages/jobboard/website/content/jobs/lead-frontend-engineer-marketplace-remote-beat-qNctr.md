The Lead Frontend Engineer will focus on tools that help with Matching which sits in our Marketplace Tribe. You will be responsible for providing the best ride-hailing experience in the market. This will be achieved through providing optimal tooling for matching a passenger with a driver quickly and safely at the click of a button. You will be working approximately 70% on mapping and may also work in other areas of our Marketplace Tribe and across our other Tribes too \[Driver, Passenger & Tesla Tribe / Payments & Fraud Tribe / Core Technology Tribe\].

Joining Beat’s Frontend Chapter means you will be challenged with multiple projects across different business domains. Your focus will be to deliver tools and dashboards that empower the whole company to operate efficiently via a data driven approach.

You will have the opportunity not only to work with our existing codebase but also to explore the latest tools & frameworks required in new projects. Here, you will engage in the design and decision making process for frontend projects. This will involve partnering with colleagues in cross-functional teams and your chapter of frontend engineers. You will be a key contributor to our shared libraries as well as on improving our design system. 

Your main goal will be to support operational excellence. We set the bar high on all of our projects and aim for a great user experience, polished UIs with code that reflects quality and is fun to work with. As a result, you should feel & act as an owner of our teams' work, test and assure that our projects always meet requirements and end users expectations. 

You are a person that wants to contribute to the frontend chapter with best practices, ideas and initiatives to automate things. You are potentially also intrigued by the idea of mentoring others and enjoy utilising your expertise by helping your teammates to upskill.

**Our Marketplace Tribe:**

Marketplace's goal is to manage supply (drivers) and demand (passengers) in the most optimal way. This is achieved by 2 domains within our Marketplace Tribe:

1.  **Matching**: responsible for finding the best possible driver for each passenger. This involves firstly finding the closest drivers to the passenger, filtering and ranking them based on a range of attributes. We then communicate with drivers on the request and handle all interactions with the driver until they are dispatched. 
2.  **Pricing:** providing a win-win-win \[driver-passenger-business\] pricing strategy that allows for smarter price decisions, match between supply and demand, and competitiveness in our markets.
