*   Team up with designers and copywriters to develop top quality creative and texts to target various audiences in 6 languages
*   Set up A/B tests, run cohort analysis, measure the performance of your campaigns and optimize the ROI
*   Team up with data analysts and engineers to improve our campaign measurement and attribution models
*   Run keyword analysis and store experiments to optimize our app store performance (ASO)

**Why you will love it**

*   You’ll join an international and fully remote team spread across whole Europe with a common mission - to inspire great adventures, making them accessible to all
