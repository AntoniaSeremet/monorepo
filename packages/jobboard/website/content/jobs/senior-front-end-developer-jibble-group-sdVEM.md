## About Jibble Group

We’re a scale-up in the Workforce Management space that has fully embraced remote work since 2017. Headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, we have 65 staff in 13 different countries.

We launched PayrollPanda.my and Jibble.io in 2016 and 2017 respectively. PayrollPanda has become Malaysia’s leading cloud payroll software, and Jibble an award-winning time clock solution, targeting the fastest-growing region in the world - South-East Asia.

*   Writing Unit, Functional and e2e Tests to ensure code robustness and documentation
