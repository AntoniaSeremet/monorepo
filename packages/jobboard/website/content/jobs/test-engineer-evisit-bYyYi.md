## Description

Hello there! I’m the VP of engineering at eVisit. We are growing the engineering team, and we’d like you to consider joining us.

I joined eVisit because I believe in the company’s mission: to simplify healthcare delivery to everyone, everywhere. We are creating technology to make it simpler for you to connect with your doctor, without having to go into the office.

eVisit’s product is very popular among healthcare professionals. Usage increased by a factor of 10 in just a few months during 2020, and it’s accelerating. As you can imagine, the team needs to grow!

I came to eVisit to build the best telemedicine platform on the planet. If you join us in 2021, you can put your hand on the steering wheel with us and leave a big mark on this team and the entire healthcare industry. If you’ve ever wished you could look back at a hugely successful company and say “I was part of that”, this is your chance.

**Where’s the job?**

We are 100% remote, and staying that way. We are able to hire engineers in all 50 states and internationally. You can work from wherever you want. Our team was distributed internationally even before the pandemic. It’s baked into how we work.

**What's the job?**

We need manual, exploratory testers to validate the new software that our engineers create. You will be a member of the same team as the engineers who create the software you validate, reporting to the same manager, and working on the same mission.

You may also be called upon to reproduce challenging bugs, investigate issues, and find answers to technical questions.

We don't want anyone in the eVisit engineering department to perform manual, repetitive tasks. But occasionally, you will be called upon to do manual, checklist-driven regression testing as well, until we finish building out our full automated end-to-end regression tests.

You won't need to write code, but you do need to be very technology savvy and have good eye for detail. You will work with software engineers very closely, and we'd love to hire people who are interested in learning to code.

**Our interview process**

We believe you shouldn’t have to disappear from your current job for an entire day to interview with us.

**Here’s how it works:**

*   A 30-minute info call with our recruiter or VP of engineering
*   A 60-minute session with our QA team

## Requirements

*   Ability to find and clearly report bugs in pre-release software
*   Excellent written communication skills, specifically focused on describing steps to reproduce bugs in software, documenting test cases, and reporting progress on tasks
*   Experience using iOS and Android as a "power user".
*   Experience testing software applications that use audio and video
*   Experience using Firefox and Chrome
*   Experience with Test Flight and Test Rail is a plus
*   Experience with the Chrome developer console is a plus

## Benefits

*   Competitive salary based on experience
*   Great benefits package including medical, dental, vision, HSA & FSA plans
*   401(k)
*   Generous PTO plan, plus 10 paid national holidays
*   A fun, collaborative environment where the company is working to define the future of telemedicine
*   Excellent opportunity for professional growth
*   100% remote work
