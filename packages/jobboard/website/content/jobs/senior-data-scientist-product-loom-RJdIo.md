*   Strong analytical and communication skills with the ability to synthesize insights into compelling stories
*   Experience designing, running, and analyzing A/B tests, with a strong understanding of applied probability and statistics
*   Good product and business sense
*   Proficiency in SQL (Snowflake, Postgres) - able to write structured and efficient queries on large data sets
*   Experience with a statistical scripting language (e.g. R or Python)
*   Experience with a Business Intelligence tool (e.g. Tableau or Mode)
*   Experience with ETL tools such as Airflow or DBT is a plus
*   A Bachelor’s Degree in a quantitative field or higher.
