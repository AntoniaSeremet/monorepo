## Description

**Who are we?**

Interested in joining a start-up that champions independent vintage furniture design? A company where "Sustainability" is not just a marketing term - but something that’s at the heart of the business model?

Vinterior is on a mission to become the most loved brand for vintage-lovers across the globe. In less than four years, we have become the leading vintage marketplace in the UK. With a community of over 1,800 vintage sellers that power 180,000 vintage products on the platform.

**About the Product team**

We’re currently a team of 9, comprising of 3 Full Stack Engineers, 4 Senior Full Stack Engineers, 1 Senior Product Designer and the Head of Engineering.

As a team, we encourage (but don't force) pairing. We love to experiment and are currently working in 6-week cycles similar to the process documented in the book [Shape up by Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

We like to keep our tickets small and deploy early and often (we do multiple deploys every day).

You can [v](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)iew our Engineering best practices here to get a better understanding of what we care about and how we work.

**Our culture**

We are ambitious, hard-working, and dedicated to our mission. We know that building a global market leader will be hard, and we are excited about the challenges that we will encounter on the way. We do not give up.

We voice our opinions whatever our title or tenure. We speak openly and challenge each other directly in the pursuit of self-growth and development. We value impact over ‘looking good’. We hold ourselves to high standards, especially when it comes to offering the best service and product to our customers.

We are curious and insatiable learners. We experiment, share our failures openly and celebrate our successes with pride. We move fast, fail fast, learn fast.

If you thrive in a fast-paced environment, like the thrill of constant change, can manage the ups and downs that come with the startup journey then join us on this exciting adventure.

**Problems we’re solving**

With big ambitions come big problems. Here are some of the biggest challenges we face…

*   **Become our Seller's favourite platform.** Our sellers range from single-person businesses to bigger better-resourced organisations. Our aim is to empower them to be the best sellers out there, grow their businesses and become their favourite online platform in the process.
*   **Discoverability.** As our inventory has continued to grow, the tools required to find that perfect piece on Vinterior also need to improve. This is a big problem domain for us and it ranges from developing a best in class search experience to working on improving our recommendations engine and our product creation flows.
*   **Building sustainable organic user growth.** We are committed to growing our user base via organic search. This has and will continue to involve a lot of engineering work to optimise our ability to rank highly in Google including tools for our SEO team to move fast and compete for top search terms to front-end performance optimisations.

**What does our Stack look like?**

Our current setup is a MVC Rails application hosted on Heroku. Our front end uses modern JS tooling such as Webpack, Stimulus and React to power aspects of the customer experience as well as Rails ERB partials.

## Requirements

**We’re looking for people with**

*   2 or more years of professional experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ruby web development
*   Enthusiasm for front-end development and creating great user experiences
*   Great collaboration and communication skills
*   A love of learning

**Bonus points if you have any of the following**

*   Experience with Ruby on Rails
*   Experience with ReactJS and/or Stimulus JS
*   Experience optimising the performance of a rails application and the front-end
*   Experience managing software projects
*   Worked in a startup
*   Worked in a remote team
*   TDD experience
*   Product focused
*   Strong writing skills
*   Like to pair (but we won’t force you to!)

**What to expect when you apply**

*   You can expect to hear back from us within 1 week.
*   We’ll organise a quick phone call to talk you through the role and learn a bit more about you. This will likely be with either our COO or Head of Engineering.
*   We'll organise a technical assessment involving a take-home coding task and/or code review exercise with a member of the engineering team. There will be no whiteboarding or technical grilling.
*   Finally, there will be a culture and values assessment with our COO and our Head of Engineering.
*   If all goes well we will make an offer to you as soon as possible.
