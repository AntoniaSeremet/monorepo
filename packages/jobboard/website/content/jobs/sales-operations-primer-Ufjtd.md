## Description

**The Challenge**

Primer kicked off this year to transform the payments technology space. All companies buy and sell, but Primer believe we can do this better - we’re developing an open payments infrastructure for merchants, freeing them to work with multiple providers through our one API.

In one year, we've secured our Series A and grown to a team of 30+ people. There's a lot of potential and growth for 2021, and we're looking for someone to be part of it, to bring structure and order to a scaling sales team.

**What will the role involve?**

*   Working closely with the GTM team in setting goals and forecasts - we have ambitious growth plans for 2021 and need someone to make sure we're on track!
*   Owning the implementation and adoption of HubSpot/Salesforce, ensuring data is tracked so we can track key metrics - pipeline velocity, win/loss rates, quota attainment, and more
*   Monitoring the health of the sales pipeline and help the team identify and resolve any blockers
*   Own the tracking of the sales funnel, delivering insights on our performance throughout the year and suggesting improvements where possible
*   Collaborating with peers to make Primer a success - we're a growing company, where everyone can have an input into how things are being done

## Requirements

*   Previous experience in a Sales Operations role, ideally within a start-up where you've built in structure as the team has scaled
*   An understanding of the sales process and 'what good looks like' relating to pipeline and forecast management
*   An interest in data and how we can use it to continuously improve
*   The ability to collaborate and communicate with the Primer team
*   The ability to work in a fast-paced environment with varied, changing objectives - and the ability to balance and prioritise these
*   Comfort with ambiguity, and the ability to build more structure in as we scale
*   Drive and ambition - we're a company that's growing fast, and we want you to grow with us!

## Benefits

*   **Shared ownership:** Joining Primer means that you will own part of the company
*   **Flexible working:** We're output-oriented so where you work, when you work, how you work - that's up to you
*   **Technology:** get hooked up with the tools you need to do your best work
*   **Home office setup:** create your perfect at-home working environment — on us
*   **Personal development:** Need books or other learning resources? They're on us
*   **Referral bonus:** refer-a-friend and help shape the team
*   **Company retreats:** quarterly "workations" and bi-annual retreats (when possible!)
