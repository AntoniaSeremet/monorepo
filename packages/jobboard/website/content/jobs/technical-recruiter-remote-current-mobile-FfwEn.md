## Technical Recruiter Role and Responsibilities

To further our mission, we are looking for a recruitment leader to source and hire talent across a wide range of technology roles at Current as we embark on the next phase of our incredible growth. As we continue to scale, how should we evolve our talent acquisition strategy? How should the hiring strategy evolve with a remote-first workplace?

This is a fantastic opportunity to join a well-funded, rapidly growing company in a high-profile role that will have a direct impact on technology talent acquisition and strategic decision making at Current. The individual will bring experience, energy, and insight as they work within teams and across key departments and product lines to acquire exceptional technical talent to ensure key hiring goals are timely fulfilled. You can expect high impact and wide-ranging responsibility: owning full-cycle recruiting, driving hiring strategy, leading first-in-kind searches, and delivering best-in-class candidate experience. This person must be a builder who thrives in a learning environment—unafraid to try new things, embrace new ideas, and welcome suggestions for how we can iterate on our processes.

## How We Work

Current is committed to learning, exploring new ideas & alternatives, and is united by curiosity. We are results-driven, use OKRs to guide us on our decisions, and emphasize goal accomplishment.

We put emphasis on the following Values:

*   **Lead with Purpose**
    *   Leadership does not necessarily mean management. Everyone is a leader, no matter the role. Taking pride in your responsibilities, finding & executing solutions is key.

*   **Focus on the ‘Why’**
    *   The best solutions start with everyone understanding the problem and its impact. We’ve found that if someone understands the ‘why’, they will produce an innovative ‘what’ and ‘how’. If we cannot explain the ‘why’ clearly, we don’t understand the problem ourselves.

*   **Bring a Sense of Humor**
    *   Our work environment is a lighthearted & positive place where employees are united by humor and camaraderie; we believe laughter is a great way to uplift employee morale and form bonds with each other.

*   **Set New Precedents**
    *   We drive innovation and push boundaries for all company activities while understanding that anything worth doing will have roadblocks. We set a new standard of worth for people’s time, data, and attention while rewarding what most other companies take.

*   **Collaboration**
    *   We won’t thrive without recognizing others strengths. Listen and evolve together, helping and supporting each other for the sake of a collective goal.

We believe in the following workplace Norms:

*   **Honor Commitments, Your Word Matters**
    *   Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant & Timely (S.M.A.R.T) Asks & Answers

*   **Allow OKRs To Guide Us**
    *   Individual & Departmental OKRs will largely impact success at Current

*   **Agree to Disagree & Commit**
    *   Voice concerns in a respectful & appropriate manner directly to your manager or the Executive Team

*   **Assume Positive Intent**
    *   Always start from the idea that a person meant well or was doing their best, no matter what they say or do
