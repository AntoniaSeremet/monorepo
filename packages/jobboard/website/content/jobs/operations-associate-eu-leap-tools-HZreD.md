## Operations Associate

You go above and beyond to help customers and co-workers wherever possible. You’re able to extract key insights from conversations with users, guiding us in building the best product possible. You challenge ideas - not the people behind them - and welcome having your ideas challenged. You take ownership in your work, and strive to produce only the highest quality output.

We are well funded and growing exponentially. Last year, our revenue grew faster than Uber when they were our size. We are building the world's most advanced tools for retail and e-commerce. Our customers include European manufacturers such as Parador and Haro, Fortune 500 companies such as Mohawk Industries, and leading global brands such as Saint-Gobain and Del Conca. We are looking for obsessive and collaborative challenge-seekers to amplify our momentum and help us create an iconic tech company.What You’ll Do

*   Be on the front lines with our customers - helping them add our visualizer to their website and ensuring they get the most out of the visualizer afterwards
*   Assist customers with issues as they come in and create universal solutions to ensure that problems don’t persist
*   Bridge the gap between our users and our product team by understanding users needs and proposing product tweaks that address them
*   Improve existing processes and build new processes from the ground up as we aggressively scale the business and expand our offerings across Europe

Requirements

*   Proficient in English
*   Strong with 2 or more of the following languages: German, Italian, Spanish, or French
*   A passion for solving problems on your own
*   The ability to manage several projects simultaneously while meeting firm deadlines
*   You know when to ask for help, but you’re also able to make decisions and move on
*   Comfortable with solving basic technical website issues

## About our culture

*   We work in tight-knit teams to maximize speed and cultivate an ownership mentality.
*   We cherish curiosity and an obsession for details because we know these details are invaluable over the long run.
*   We promote an open environment where ideas are challenged. The best ideas win.
*   We judge ourselves based on our achievements and our ability to execute on our promises. We act with urgency.
*   We love to compete and have fun. Beware of our game nights!

## Results

5x increase in e-commerce conversion rates and a dramatic decrease in the time it takes to make a purchase decision. We are also reducing carbon footprint by eliminating trips to the store and avoiding product returns, while also saving marriages -- because now you can be sure the products you buy for your home will fit and look good.

About our office and remote work

We are conveniently located in downtown Toronto with nearby access to both of the main subway lines. Our office is spacious with roomy desks, comfortable chairs, and top tech gear. The kitchen is packed with essentials including healthy snacks, exotic teas and fresh ground coffee. And we are surrounded by great restaurants and food options. The only downside is we don't have any plants (yet).

Many of us choose to work from home, either full-time or partially. We encourage our teams to work from wherever they are most productive. We’ve come up with a few ways to keep everyone on the same page, including a quick company-wide check-in every Monday, remote coffee breaks on Fridays, and ad-hoc topical sharing sessions. Another big upside is you get to be around plants (if you have them).
