As a Technical Support Manager within Awesome Motive, you’ll be responsible for ensuring the success of one of our world-class WordPress support teams. You'll work remotely with Senior Support to coordinate all team members, lead numerous responsibilities and initiatives within support, and continually reinforce a positive, team-oriented culture. 

To love this role, here’s the type of person you are:

*   You’re an excellent and consistent communicator who makes sure nothing slips through the cracks.
*   You are extremely reliable; others know they can always count on you. When unexpected things come up, or you're under time pressure, you not only stay calm -- but you're eager to rise to the occasion and help your team rise with you.
*   You find deep satisfaction in helping others to grow and succeed. Further, you have a knack for motivating and instilling confidence in others.
*   You don't shy away from difficult conversations, and know that critical feedback is vital for an individual and team to succeed long-term.
*   You enjoy identifying patterns and trends, and using those to thoughtfully determine both short and long term action plans.
*   You consistently model values and behaviors that demonstrate a high standard of integrity.
*   You’re a self-starter who loves taking initiative and seeing things through to completion.
*   You're a committed life-long learner, and know that you have at least as much to learn from your team as they do from you.
*   You take pride in the quality and craftsmanship of your work rather than just doing it to get it done.

Responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

*   Setting a high standard of performance goals and KPIs for the support team, and ensuring the team consistently meets or exceeds these goals.
*   Continually monitoring and providing feedback on the performance of senior support.  
    
*   Frequently checking in with senior support about the performance of their reports, and determining the most appropriate actions based on both their feedback and your personal observations/experiences.
*   Communicating regularly with the support team, including leading weekly support team meetings.
*   Organizing and leading support trainings.
*   Onboarding new support team members.  
    
*   Delegating support responsibilities, and helping senior support to manage fluctuating workloads.  
    
*   Providing written and verbal performance reviews for your team.
*   Managing time off requests and scheduling.
*   Assisting with support team hiring.
*   Coordinating with team members outside of support to make sure everyone is on the same page.
*   Ensuring that all internal support team documentation stays up to date.
*   Communicating frequently with the team using chat, audio, and video.

Skills you'll need to succeed in this role:

*   At least 2 years of experience managing a team of 10 or more.
*   Excellent English writing and communication skills, including a strong ability to show empathy in your writing. We believe communication is **critical**.
*   Strong leadership with the ability to step up and take charge.
*   Patience, grace, and a sense of humor.
*   Talent for taking something complicated and explaining it simply.  
    
*   Ability to prioritize workloads in order to balance an assortment of tasks and meet deadlines.
*   Exceptional problem-solving abilities.
*   Experience using WordPress.

## Bonus points if you also have:

*   Proven track record working in a support team for WordPress plugins.  
    
*   Experience managing a team remotely.
*   Experience using Awesome Motive products, such as WPForms, WP Mail SMTP, MonsterInsights, OptinMonster, etc.
*   Experience working with the major services that many of our products integrate with (Zapier, Mailchimp, Drip, Stripe, etc).
*   Experience with WordPress development (eg themes, hooks, filters, plugin API, PHP,  etc).
