## Job description

## The Opportunity

RebelMouse is providing an exciting opportunity to candidates with a love for technology and the ability to understand and address the needs and desires of customers, ranging from CTOs to non-technical users.

We love people who bring value beyond their core expertise, who care about ideas and concepts, and who want their voice to be heard.

## Who We’re Looking For

We’re looking for an engaging and charismatic individual who inspires others about technology, is motivated by helping clients succeed, has a keen attention to detail, and excels at bridging the gap between technical client needs and product capabilities.This is a position for someone who has a passion for learning, loves fast-paced work environments, and continuously exceeds expectations.
