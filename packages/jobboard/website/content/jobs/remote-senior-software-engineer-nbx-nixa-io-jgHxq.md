## Description

Nixa.io is currently working with NBX to hire their next Senior Software Engineer.

Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) is a pioneering, Norwegian cryptocurrency exchange, custodian, and payment system that sets the standard for user experience, transparency, and security. NBX is its own, independent company but comes with the Norwegian Air Shuttle heritage, meaning that it is by default going to move fast, grow fast and look for and try new ways of doing things. The company is headquartered in Norway, but have a distributed team across Europe and Canada.

As a Senior Software Engineer at NBX, you'll participate in all areas of the application development life-cycle. You'll work with exciting technologies such as Python and Go in a microservice context together with Kubernetes, Kafka, and Cassandra. In this role, you will have the opportunity to work as a software developer with a distributed and passionate team delivering the platform and the infrastructure of both the cryptocurrency exchange and the digital ecosystem. We're looking for senior software engineers to join our engineering team and help us achieve our high ambitions to build the best cryptocurrency exchange and a digital ecosystem for consumers and institutions on a global level, optimizing ways for businesses across industries to operate.

**Responsibilities**

*   Design, implement, deploy and support event-driven microservices with a focus on high availability, high performance, low latency, and scalability
*   Develop software that is part of critical user journeys across our platform
*   Deliver on some of our most impactful projects by collaborating closely with SRE, Frontend, Product and Business teams to build, test, deploy and release new features to production
*   Operate highly available microservices, including taking part in an on-call rotation

## Requirements

*   5+ years of experience developing microservices for large scale production services using Python, Go, Java, C#, C++ or equivalent language
*   2+ years of experience with one (or more) of the following: Kafka, Cassandra, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, Docker, GCP, AWS, Blockchain, or trading systems
*   Experience designing and developing RESTful APIs and/or Serverless Workers
*   Solid understanding of software testing principles
*   Technology agnostic and eager to learn new languages, frameworks, patterns, etc.
*   Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written (English)
*   Self-motivated and self-managing, with strong organizational skills
*   Good work ethics are necessary as teams will be working independently within their areas of responsibility
*   _Located in Europe (CET+/- 3 hours)_

**It would be a big bonus if you also have:**

*   Strong knowledge of event-driven microservice architecture
*   Experience building Decentralized Finance software products
*   Experience with trading platforms
*   Experience with Configuration-Management and/or Secrets-Management
*   Experience with WebSockets programming
*   Strong interest in cryptocurrency
*   Experience working in a tech startup environment

## Benefits

You will report to NBXâ€™s Director of Technology and work collaboratively with the entire tech team. You will have the opportunity to shape the role and your direction as well as help to shape a company in its early and exciting development stages.

Hopefully, the opportunity to be a big part of something different and undefined is the big draw, but of course, there are other benefits. Apart from your salary, you can expect, for example:

*   A fully remote position from anywhere in Europe
*   A good work-life balance and allowances for flexible work hours
*   Staff tickets on Norwegian Air Shuttle network after three months of employment
