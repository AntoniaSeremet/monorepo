Hey! Brian from [Customer.io](http://customer.io) here - we're looking for someone with a background in building mobile apps to help us create tools that improve the lives of your fellow app developers.

## As a Lead Mobile Engineer at [Customer.io](http://Customer.io), you will guide our mobile SDK engineering efforts as well as help us shape our roadmap with genuine empathy for mobile developers. You'll create the tools that mobile app companies use to trigger messages (push notifications, in-app messages, sms, emails, etc) without getting bogged down with high-cost coordination between marketing and engineering.

## As a Lead Mobile Engineer at [Customer.io](http://Customer.io), you will...

*   Be the technical lead for the team that builds and maintain the mobile SDKs that help mobile app companies integrate with us.
*   Work closely with our frontend and backend engineers to connect the mobile SDKs into our product. If you're familiar with Ember or Go, there's flexibility to contribute across multiple parts of our stack.
*   Keep up to date with the latest iOS and Android platform capabilities, partnering with product management to help guide a roadmap that factors in the needs of developers.
*   Learn, practice, and share with your coworkers through code review, team collaboration, and training to help improve our collective knowledge and best practices together.
*   Be a model and mentor for writing well-architected, well-tested, and easy to understand code.

## About your team...

*   You'll join our engineering team, pairing up with Frontend Emberistas, Backend Gophers, SRE MySQLers, and QA Dismantlers.
*   We work in squads: small work teams with everyone needed to accomplish a business outcome.
*   You'll be a true co-owner of the solution alongside the rest of your squad.
*   You'll be supported by a technical writer to create documentation for developers who are integrating the code you write.

## What we're looking for...

*   Experience shipping code in a production environment on both iOS and Android apps, but you don't need to be an expert in both.
*   Capable of building and owning major production components from the ground up.
*   A product focus. You're comfortable jumping between customer viewpoint and technical architecture to help us make tough tradeoffs.
*   Excellent written and verbal communication skills, bonus if you've developed those while working with a distributed team.
*   Ideally located in UTC -4 to -7 to maximize working hours overlap with your squad.
*   (Bonus - not required!) Shout if you've worked in Go or Ember and are excited about working across multiple levels of our tech stack.

## About [Customer.io](http://Customer.io)

*   Health and wellness allowance - Up to $200 USD per month that can be used for your healthy living needs, including gym membership, acupuncture, massage, or bike repairs
*   Home office stipend - Up to $2,000 USD to help you get your home office set up so you can do your best work
*   Internet + cell phone reimbursement - Up to $200 USD per month for your internet and cell phone plans
*   Co-working space reimbursement - Up to $300 USD per month for those times you'd prefer to work in a co-working environment
*   Learning + development - Up to $2,000 USD reimbursement per year to use on conferences, books, classes, or workshops - anything that will help you develop your skills
*   1 month paid sabbatical after four years at [Customer.io](http://Customer.io) - to treat yourself to a vacation, or spend however you choose
*   Company retreats twice a year - we typically get together IRL every spring and fall, but most recently had an amazing virtual retreat!
*   Flexible schedule, work anywhere you want! - as long as you have a reliable internet connection and some overlapping work time with your manager, you can work where and when you want

All final candidates will be asked to complete an employment and education verification authorization form (which allows us to verify your job history and education listed on your resume) as part of our pre-employment process.

[Customer.io](http://Customer.io) recognizes the stifling impact of systemic injustice on diverse communities.
