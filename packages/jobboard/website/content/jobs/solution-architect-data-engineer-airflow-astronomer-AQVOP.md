## Job description

**Astronomer helps organizations adopt Apache Airflow,** the market’s leading open-source data workflow orchestration platform. We’re a fast-growing startup pushing forward to make Apache Airflow the open source standard for data orchestration.

As a Solution Architect on our team, you will get a front row seat to almost all aspects of the company and help ensure that our growth is guided by strong technical alignment with the needs of our users. You will grow to have a deep understanding of both Apache Airflow and Astronomer as you work with organizations ranging from seed stage startups to Fortune 50 enterprises.

You’ll be able to speak to and deliver solutions around Apache Airflow and the Astronomer platform. You'll work closely with our sales reps(as a technical pre-sales resource) and play a key role in winning deals and driving the business forward. You'll be a trusted advisor and help architect solutions across all types of environments and use cases. Last but not least, you’ll have the opportunity to engage with the Apache Airflow project, a thriving open source community with over 1000 contributors.

Every Solutions Engineer will grow to become an Airflow expert and be a trusted advisor to organizations looking to put their data in motion.

*   Work cross functionally within the organization to create and maintain deep technical content for the larger Apache Airflow community
*   Act as a liaison, collecting feedback from the field to relay back to the Product team
*   Become an Airflow expert
