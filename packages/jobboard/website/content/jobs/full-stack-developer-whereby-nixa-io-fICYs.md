## Description

Nixa.io is currently working with [Whereby](https://whereby.com/) to help grow their product teams by hiring talented and passionate full-stack developers.

Whereby is on a mission to give people the freedom to live and work wherever they thrive. Their global HQ is in Oslo, Noway, but their users (and team) are worldwide - having been used in every country in the world by millions of folk. 🌏

By making it possible to collaborate as well over video as you can in real life, Whereby wants to give you the choice to work from where your life happens. To allow you to be in a place where you can think and focus, but also allow a seamless and instant connection with others when you need to.

For their 90 team members, and also for their customers, they know that the ability to decouple location from work can be life-changing. They can afford the house they want, can spend less time commuting, be closer to nature, and their children get to grow up seeing their grandparents every day. Everyone on their team enjoys the enormous benefits that a flexible work policy brings, and they truly believe the future of work will gravitate towards our vision of the future.

**Engineering at Whereby**

Whereby strongly believe in the superpowers of a well-led, and expertly designed engineering team. They are an engineering-centric business that hopes to scale their operation sustainably, with beautiful code, an ethical approach to their users and data, and an innovative opinion on new technologies in the market. They try to ensure both that they’re building the right thing and building the thing right. They analyse data, talk to users, prototype and iterate. They focus on discovering and solving user problems, not just building and shipping features. As a member of their engineering team, you’ll take on a key role in this process and see your work be used by millions of users worldwide.

We´re looking for a passionate engineer who has experience of customer-centric, iterative product work in a startup – or any company that values innovation, great user experience and technical quality. You’ll be working in one of the Product teams, and you’ll work directly with your Product Manager on your day-to-day priorities. You’ll report to an Engineering manager who will work with you on your progression - aiming to make sure you’re happy, challenged and doing the best work of your career every day. They’ll also help you find training and development opportunities.
