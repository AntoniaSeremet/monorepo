## Job description

**Graphic Designer**

Luckbox is an esports betting platform built around the ethos of ‘Esports Betting Done Right’. As our team continues to grow, we immediately require a qualified candidate to fill the role of Graphic Designer.

Overview

Working closely with the Director of Product, the primary focus of this role will be interpreting the Luckbox brand guidelines to define an overall look and feel for brand communications across all campaign touchpoints - this includes social channels, on-site banners, print and merchandise and digital advertising.

You will be expected to interpret creative briefs for marketing campaigns and iterate design solutions through a process of mood boards, scamps, and pixel-perfect artwork. On approval, you'll work within established SLA timelines to deliver optimised assets to stakeholders across Marketing.

As you become established within the company, you’ll be expected to take ownership of our visual aesthetic and act as a gatekeeper for brand values and brand execution.

You’ll also occasionally be required to provide UI support to our in-house Front End development team. This includes creating user interface assets based on existing UI style guides, and to create wireframes and mockups to help senior management signoff on new features and product updates.

## Job requirements

Requirements

*   4+ years experience as a visual designer / graphic designer
*   Significant experience working with brand guidelines and a demonstrable appreciation of brand theory
*   Absolute fluency in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator
*   Keen eye for design and exceptional attention to detail with a solid understanding of colour theory, typography, layout and iconography
*   Ability to produce creative ideas and solutions from brief to completion and ability to present design decisions to internal stakeholders
*   Some experience with Sketch/Figma is advantageous
*   The ideal candidate will have a combination of in-house and agency experience

This position is a communications role. All applicants should have exceptional English language skills and confidence discussing & presenting their work in English.

All candidates must provide a portfolio of design work with their application.

Knowledge of esports and gaming is advantageous, although it is not a prerequisite for the role.

Remote work option may be considered for suitable candidates. Occasional travel within the EU may be required, once COVID health and safety measures allow.

Luckbox is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
