## About the process:

Our interviewing process should take about 2 weeks. During this time, usually we will hold three interviews of around one hour each. We don't require you to perform any coding challenge and we won't ask any algorithmic or tricky questions.

We do want to give you the chance to show us your technical and communication skills in a comfortable and positive environment. We believe the best way to achieve this is for you to prepare some code that you have written and think is worth sharing with us. It does not have to be something you craft specially for this occasion, but some interesting real life problem you have solved in the past that we can go through together, and have some discussions around it.
