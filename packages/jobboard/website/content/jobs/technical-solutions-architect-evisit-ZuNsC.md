## Description

Hello there! I’m the VP of engineering at eVisit. We are growing the engineering team, and we’d like you to consider joining us.

I joined eVisit because I believe in the company’s mission: to simplify healthcare delivery to everyone, everywhere. We are creating technology to make it simpler for you to connect with your doctor, without having to go into the office.

eVisit’s product is very popular among healthcare professionals. Usage increased by a factor of 10 in just a few months during 2020, and it’s accelerating. As you can imagine, the team needs to grow!

I came to eVisit to build the best telemedicine platform on the planet. If you join us in 2021, you can put your hand on the steering wheel with us and leave a big mark on this team and the entire healthcare industry. If you’ve ever wished you could look back at a hugely successful company and say “I was part of that”, this is your chance.

**Where’s the job?**

We are 100% remote, and staying that way. We are able to hire people in all 50 states and internationally. You can work from wherever you want. Our team was distributed internationally even before the pandemic. It’s baked into how we work.

**What's the job?**

Our customers are advanced healthcare systems. Many of them have development teams who build custom integrations with our API. We need someone with a software development background to consult with these customers to help them navigate the integration development process.

If you join us, you would be involved in architecting some of the world's most advanced automated healthcare software systems. Patients and providers will have a seamless healthcare delivery experience, thanks to your work. You won't need to write a lot of code, but you will need to have experience with code, so you can advise developers and know how to respond to issues as they arise.

The ideal candidate loves helping teams solve problems, giving advice, is good with people, and occasionally jumps on a sales call to discuss how a prospective customer would use eVisit successfully.

**Our interview process**

We believe you shouldn’t have to disappear from your current job for an entire day to interview with us. We also believe you shouldn’t have to write code for a live audience, but rather we want you to code on your own time, in your own environment, where you do your best work.

Here’s how it works:

*   A 30-minute info call with our recruiter or VP of engineering
*   A 30-minute call with our VP of product management
*   A 60-minute session with our engineering team
*   A take-home coding exercise
*   A group session for you to meet the team

## Requirements

*   Experience writing code, even if you don't do that much any more
*   Ability to ramp up on eVisit's API and become an expert adviser to the development teams who use it
*   Experience writing technical documentation for a developer audience
*   Strong verbal communication skills with customers -- confidence acting as the technical face of eVisit to our customers

## Benefits

*   Competitive salary based on experience
*   Great benefits package including medical, dental, vision, HSA & FSA plans
*   401(k)
*   Generous PTO plan, plus 10 paid national holidays
*   A fun, collaborative environment where the company is working to define the future of telemedicine
*   Excellent opportunity for professional growth
*   100% remote work
