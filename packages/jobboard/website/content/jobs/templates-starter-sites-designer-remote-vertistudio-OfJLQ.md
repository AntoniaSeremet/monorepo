## About us

We're a friendly group of designers, developers, testers, and marketers having a great time building themes at ThemeIsle, sharing the best content at CodeinWP, and straight-up innovating with Optimole.

## Our mission

Make it easy for anyone in the world to launch & grow their online presence, through education, high-quality products, and reliable support.

## About the role

We’re looking for a Templates/Starter Sites designer that will join the design team. You will help create new templates and starter sites for various niches to be used in our WordPress themes.

## Requirements

Note: it is not required that you have all of these! Teams have varying needs, focuses, and use varying technologies.

*   Minimum of 2+ years experience building graphical designs
*   Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS
*   Good knowledge of any WordPress page builder ( Elementor/Gutenberg/Beaver/Divi, etc )
*   Good knowledge of tools like Figma/Sketch
*   Knowledge of working with design systems
*   Understanding of responsive design and its implementation
*   Extensive knowledge of the WordPress ecosystem
*   Ability to work in cross-functional teams
*   Good analytical and debugging skills

## Who you are?

*   You’re independent, take initiative often, and come up with your own ideas. Being entirely responsible for a project – from start to finish – doesn't scare you.
*   You're a great communicator and have excellent levels of English, both spoken and written. In our company, communication is key.
*   You are curious and keen to learn new things. Developing new skills is one of your main goals.
*   You love to add value and get deeply involved in everything you're building. You always try to deliver the best possible product.
*   You enjoy working in a team and helping other developers.
*   You use feedback to improve yourself and do not see it as a personal criticism.    
*   You don't mind taking care of tasks of all sizes – from bug fixes to large features.
