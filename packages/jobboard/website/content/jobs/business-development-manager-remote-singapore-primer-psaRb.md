## Description

Primer kicked off this year to transform the payments technology space. All companies buy and sell, but Primer believe we can do this better - we’re developing an open payments infrastructure for merchants, freeing them to work with multiple providers through our one API.

Our ex-Paypal leadership team have already grown the team to 20+ in the last ten months, and with a recent round of funding from Balderton Capital (who also invested in Revolut and GoCardless) we’ll be scaling our Business Development & Partnerships team worldwide.

**What is the role?**

*   Understanding our product inside out, to be able to solution sell to our partners and prospective merchants
*   Winning new business for Primer - identifying enterprise merchants to partner with in Asia, establishing and building relationships, and qualifying any new business opportunities
*   Collaborating with peers across the business
*   Reaching out to, presenting to, and developing relationships with CTOs, Heads of Payment, and CEOs of businesses across any vertical
*   Building your own pipeline and managing the sales process end to end
*   Understanding and keeping up to date with the payments landscape

## Requirements

*   Someone who is able to understand a complex, challenging problem and get to grips with it quickly - not necessarily someone who’s worked in fintech, but someone who can understand complex products and explain them to technical and non-technical clients alike
*   Experience in B2B enterprise sales
*   A highly analytical and logical approach to sales, able to structure their outreach, organise and plan
*   A confident and fluid communication style, able to collaborate at all levels internally and externally
*   Someone who understands and appreciates regulatory differences and cultural differences that can affect the sales cycle
*   A proactive, driven, and ambitious person, who can flourish in uncertainty and ambiguity
*   Someone who is open to travel within Europe next year
*   Experience in/understanding of payments is highly desirable
