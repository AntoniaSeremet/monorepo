Smoke and mirrors.

That's what our frontenders at Pleo do, if you ask me. They take the complexity of fintech and make it seem easy and simple for the customer.

That's definitely an illusion when you think of all the crazy stuff going on on the backend side of things (think 3rd party relationships with banks, accounting softwares, and card providers - let alone onboarding, document uploading, and data security). Johann Georg SchrÃ¶pfer would be blown away.

And if you think about it, this is pretty crucial stuff if you're trying to change the future of work. And even more so if you're bringing about this change through the seemingly boring world of company spending. I mean, even thinking of buying something on behalf of my company used to make my blood boil. Every candidate lunch interview, flight booked, or software bought was either out of my pocket or was from my company card that was mercilessly shared with my team. "Please don't forget to put the receipt on my desk" became a month-end scramble and whine to make sure I didn't annoy the CFO, or get expenses deducted from my salary.

So surely any minor improvement to this hair-pulling, blood-boiling, painful process would be a better alternative? I guess so: but luckily I haven't seen average work come out of our product team just yet. We're looking to hire someone who brings high integrity to their work to make sure it stays this way. Actually, that's not right. We're looking for someone to make sure we take a quantum leap and get even better.

To overcome average we try to delight our customers - we put emphasis on the end-user (every employee with a virtual or physical card) and then the accountants and admins. So as a frontender at Pleo your job is to try to make adopting a new habit intuitive, easy, and a no-brainer. The customer just needs to use their card, snap a pic of the receipt, and they're done.

And cool-ly enough: it works. It sure is satisfying when a B2B company gets Trustpilot reviews from the end user saying that "Love using Pleo - so simple and easy and my expenses are sorted immediately!" - Nichole, 25 Mar 20.

Or take Jana, who posted this on 1 may 19) "What a time saver! Doing my business expenses is a piece of cake with Pleo. It saves me so much time and hassle. Honestly, if you have to deal with business expenses - let Pleo do it for you!"

And that's just the end-user, you'll quickly find out just how many different clients are involved. Specifically when it comes to admin and bookkeepers, you'll see a huge relief from the usual pain - "we went from trial to full implementation in the whole company in about a month. Well worth the money!" - Kristian, 27 Jan 19 (Sounds like an admin if you ask me.)

The last part that you should know about is how we work. We have different teams: and each team has a founder who runs that project. That founder can be an engineer or someone in product - it is up to the project and your respective skillsets, interests, and potential. We try to match-make people with projects: there's space if you want to be a keen learner with a more experienced team, or if you want to put your hand up to run an idea yourself.

We try to be as flexible as possible here: we're not looking for specific years of experience or technical know-how. We are at a place where we can cater for a broad range of experience - if you're wondering if you're over - or under - qualified, just apply and flag that to us. We're a transparent company and will chat about realistic paths for you, and from there it's up to you to see if it'll work or not.

Over to you!

## You know your way around

*   React
*   Redux
*   TypeScript
*   CSS, PostCSS
*   Unit/Functional test skills

## Your colleagues say you

*   Work in English with ease (it's our company language)
*   Are probably already talking about React 16.8 (and are probably hooked with using hooks)
*   Never stop being curious and love learning about new languages/ frameworks/ working styles
*   Are easy to work with
*   Would be a person that they would actually like to have a coffee with (virtual or not)

## Show me the benefits!

*   Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending)
*   Ability to work remotely (anywhere between east coast of the Americas to European timezones)...
*   ...or onsite if you want to (Copenhagen, London, Berlin or Stockholm)
*   Flexible working remote options for those onsite (just speak to your team)
*   Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones)
*   Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what's reasonable, we don't have set budgets)

## And here are some other nice gestures that we do

*   Catered lunch in our HQ and London offices
*   25 days holidays (annual)
*   Loads of weird and wonderful niche communities to join in the company (we're talking guerrilla gardening, liquids tasting, the Pleo band, learning to code initiatives, Pleo dinners, board games, that type of thing)
*   Wild enthusiasm and encouragement from us if you want to host MeetUps, events, etc - we'll help (venue, food etc)

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech we've seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending.

Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote set up possible, and will fly you in once a quarter for team camps!
