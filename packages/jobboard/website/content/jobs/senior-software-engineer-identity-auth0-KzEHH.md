Auth0 is a unicorn that just closed a $120M Series F round of funding, with total capital raised to date of $330M and valuation of nearly $2B. We are growing rapidly and looking for exceptional new team members to add to our exceptional talent pool - and who will help take us to the next level of success. One team, one score. 

Our vision is to provide people with secure access to any application in one click or less. And our promise is to make identity work for everyone—whether you’re a developer looking to innovate, or a security professional looking to mitigate. We are looking for curious, excited, boundary-pushing team members. So, if you’re a big thinker who is nimble and adaptable, Auth0 may be an ideal place for you to shine.

We are looking for a Senior Engineer to join our Sessions team! This team is responsible for building out the services and infrastructure which are needed to scale sessions and refresh tokens to the billions, where reliability and latency are key. The majority of authentication and authorization transactions running through Auth0 will depend on your code, giving you the opportunity to work as part of a core product team. 

You will often work with other teams both within the Engineering organization and outside of it, in order to get a better understanding of customer needs and the impact of changes you perform.

## You will:

*   Collaborate with other engineers and teams to implement new features, improvements and fixes that need to handle our current and future scale.
*   Instrument, monitor and operate the code you write and services you build. This includes on-call rotations.
*   Help with design and code review, and ensure good engineering practices are being applied.

## You might be a good fit for this role if you:

*   Have experience building highly-reliable, mission-critical software at scale.
*   Take an iterative approach to development, dividing long-term goals into incremental milestones.
*   Have experience working in a global remote-first organization.
*   Are a good communicator and enjoy interacting with people.
*   Place a high value on security.
*   Bring the right attitude to the team: ownership, accountability, and attention to detail.
*   Have familiarity with the tools we currently use, such as Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL.

## Preferred Locations:

*   #AR; #US-E; #GMT-CA; #UK; #ES; #PL;
*   We are prioritizing candidates in Eastern (GMT-4) time zones

It’s not expected that a single candidate has expertise in all these areas. We’re looking for professional engineers, who can quickly learn and adapt as our systems and situation changes, rather than candidates with a rigid skill set.

Auth0 safeguards more than 4.5 billion login transactions each month and its top priorities are availability and security.

We like to think that we are helping make the internet safer. Our team is spread across more than 35 countries and we are proud to continually be recognized as a great place to work. Culture is critical to us, and we are transparent about our [vision and principles](https://auth0.com/blog/the-developer-first-identity-platform-auth0-story-and-future).
