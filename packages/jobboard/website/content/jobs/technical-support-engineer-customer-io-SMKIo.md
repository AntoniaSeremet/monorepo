Hi, I'm Travis, the Technical Support Manager at [Customer.io](http://customer.io/). I’m looking for a Technical Support Engineer to join our growing team.

As a Technical Support Engineer you’ll be communicating directly with our customers via our Support Center. Our team is especially excited to hear from folks with Technical Support backgrounds with experience communicating technical tasks mostly over email - a strong ability to communicate in writing is more than nice-to-have.

On a day to day, you’ll triage a diversity of support tickets as well as work on process improvement, and conduct regular touch points with our Product and Customer Success teams. You'll also help new and existing customers get up and running in our product, diagnose tricky situations and aid companies in achieving their business goals. Our TSE's have contact with more customers than anyone else in the company, so you’re our secret sauce to ensure we provide a remarkable customer experience. Our customers are core to everything we do (it’s in our name!) - so it's key to bring your passion for customers and help solve their problems to advocate for product improvements.

Today, our Technical Support team is powered by Help Scout for ticketing, Github Issues for bug tracking, and Zapier for automating support team workflows. While we mostly interact with each other through Notion and Slack, it’s not uncommon for us to jump on a Zoom pairing session or a video call to clarify customer scenarios or share tips to remedy customer issues.

Interested in growth opportunities? So are we. Our Technical Support Team has a variety of career paths, such as to our Engineering, Product, or Customer Success Teams. We're in search of folks who want to develop professionally as [Customer.io](http://customer.io/) grows.

## What we are looking for:

*   Ability to work comfortably in PST (Pacific Standard Time)
*   Experience in a technical support role and/or customer-facing role 
*   An understanding of basic programming concepts (API, variables, if-else statements, loops, etc.). If you know some Javascript too, that's even better!
*   Excellent written and verbal communication skills
*   Be motivated with a self-starter attitude
*   Previous work for a SaaS company, or an understanding of technical platforms
*   Ability to work in a fast-paced, team environment
*   Experience with Marketing Automation industry or supporting email marketing/business communication tools!

## About you:

*   You love technical problem-solving.
*   You enjoy helping others with your technical knowledge and take pride in your work.
*   You see every support ticket as an opportunity to improve the customer experience.
*   You take ownership of delivering results and get satisfaction from getting things done.
*   You’re passionate about learning new things.
*   You’re not afraid to ask questions if you’re confused about how something works.
*   You understand written communication is not always flawless and assume the best intentions during interactions with customers and your team. Empathy is one of your strongest attributes.

All final candidates will be asked to complete an employment and education verification authorization form (which allows us to verify your job history and education listed on your resume) as part of our pre-employment process.

Customer.io recognizes the stifling impact of systemic injustice on diverse communities. We commit to using our influence to increase inclusion and equity within the tech industry.
