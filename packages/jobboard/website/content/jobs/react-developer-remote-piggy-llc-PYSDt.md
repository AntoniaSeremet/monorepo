Joinpiggy.com is looking for React developers to join its technical team’s expansion. The ideal candidate will be based in a European time zone.

## What We Are Looking For

*   Previous history working as a Javascript developer.
*   Proficient in modern Javascript constructs including ES6, automation tools such as gulp or grunt, testing tools such as mocha or jasmine, and build tools such as webpack, browserify or babel, and the ability to demonstrate such knowledge.
*   At least 2 years experience using REACT in a commercial environment.
*   Experience building Chrome/Firefox browser extensions is ideal but not mandatory
*   Requires a person who can "figure it out" and a lover of challenges and puzzles. This is not your standard "Form needs validation" javascript job. Requires a lot of reverse engineering.

## Job Functions:

*   Build and update Piggy’s various browser extensions and the rulesets that allow our Apps to interact with various Merchant Websites.
*   Build and automate unit and integration test suites.
*   Build reusable code and libraries for future use.
*   Optimize applications for maximum speed and scalability.
*   Collaborate with other team members and stakeholders.
*   Contribute to team development and initiatives.
*   Occasionally assist the UI Developer with enhanced Javascript functionality as needed.

## Job Requirements:

*   Strong English language skills.
*   Excellent communication skills, including verbal, written, and presentation.
