## A few questions:

Before getting to know each other better at the interview, we would like to see your approach to the following questions. Please use the form below to answer them.

1\. Hi there, I want to buy the Hestia Pro theme. How much would it cost to use it for 1 website? 

2\. Hi ThemeIsle, I hope that you are doing fine. I bought your plugin Feedzy RSS Feeds 10 days ago and it doesn’t work for me. I feel that I waste my time trying this product. I would like my money back.

3\. Go to https://themeisle.com/ website and change the top bar (https://prnt.sc/siz30l) color to #e9f542. Also, hide the heading (WordPress themes for yer voyage) so it doesn't appear on the website. Send us the screenshot of the changed website and include the CSS styles that you used to make these changes.

4\. What’s the page builder themeisle.com is based on?
