## Description

Hello there! I’m the VP of engineering at eVisit. We are growing the engineering team, and we’d like you to consider joining us.

I joined eVisit because I believe in the company’s mission: to simplify healthcare delivery to everyone, everywhere. We are creating technology to make it simpler for you to connect with your doctor, without having to go into the office.

eVisit’s product is very popular among healthcare professionals. Usage increased by a factor of 10 in just a few months during 2020, and it’s accelerating. As you can imagine, the team needs to grow!

I came to eVisit to build the best telemedicine platform on the planet. If you join us in 2021, you can put your hand on the steering wheel with us and leave a big mark on this team and the entire healthcare industry. If you’ve ever wished you could look back at a hugely successful company and say “I was part of that”, this is your chance.

**Where’s the job?**

We are 100% remote, and staying that way. We are able to hire engineers in all 50 states and internationally. You can work from wherever you want. Our team was distributed internationally even before the pandemic. It’s baked into how we work.

**What's the job?**

We believe in automation. This extends way beyond writing application code. It includes the way we approach quality, processes, and especially infrastructure. Our infrastructure team is developing a next generation platform that will host all of our software services. We believe in serverless, and we are actively moving our systems in that direction. This includes containerization, fully automated deployments, automated testing, and alerting. If you join us, you can help us define our new architecture on AWS using Fargate, the CodeStar suite, CloudFormation and much more. On this team, you will have top-down leadership support to design and launch infrastructure that you can be proud of.

## Requirements

*   Experience with AWS. Everyone knows S3 and EC2, but we are looking for people with Fargate and CodeDeploy experience, or at least a strong desire to learn these technologies.
*   Experience automating infrastructure bring-up and maintenance for a SaaS product.
*   Experience working closely with software engineering teams.
*   Experience writing code to build tools that engineers can use to manage their own infrastructure.

## Benefits

*   Competitive salary based on experience
*   Great benefits package including medical, dental, vision, HSA & FSA plans
*   401(k)
*   Generous PTO plan, plus 10 paid national holidays
*   A fun, collaborative environment where the company is working to define the future of telemedicine
*   Excellent opportunity for professional growth
*   100% remote work
