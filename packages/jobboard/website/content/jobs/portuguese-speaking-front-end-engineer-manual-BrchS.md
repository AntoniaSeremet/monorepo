## Job description

## About Us

We are building the go-to wellness brand for men. And we’re off to a flying start.

Built by executives from TransferWise and Deliveroo, and after a £5 million seed round from Europe’s top VC’s, we’re growing at an incredible pace and recruiting top talent.

We’re creating a safe, easily accessible, welcoming place, where men have easy access to all the information, tools and solutions they need to own their wellbeing. A place that didn’t exist until now.

In Brazil, we are the first player in this promising market with an end to end solution from diagnosis to treatment delivery. We recently launched Hair Loss Treatments and now we're looking for a Front End Engineer to help us with the platform in this growth experience.
