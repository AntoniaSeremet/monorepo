## About Hire Space

Hire Space provides everything needed for businesses to host world-class virtual, hybrid, or in-person events, both in the UK and globally. As long-standing EventTech leaders, we are at the forefront of the rapidly growing world of virtual events. To help us on this journey we are seeking a Front End Engineer to join our passionate and collaborative team.

We operate the UK’s largest venue marketplace, which hosts over 6,000 venues and is used by over 2 million prospective event planners each year. Our clients include Google, Facebook, Red Bull, UNICEF, and Dr. Martens. We have built a reputation for delivering world-class virtual events and are the force behind the largest virtual Xmas party of 2020.

We’re looking for smart, curious, and self-starting people from all backgrounds to join our team. Ultimately, we're here to make events a joy.

## The Role

As a Front End Engineer, you will be responsible for delivering a fast and modern UI to our users. You’ll help make calls on front end architecture within your team and help to implement best practice in the structure of our front end codebase.

In your 3 months with us, you’ll build the front end for our new products, and help to improve and maintain the front end for existing projects. You’ll be responsible for tools that are used by millions of people every year, and to develop new products that will revolutionise the events industry. You’ll work predominantly in React, but will also work in other projects using libraries such as Knockout.js and interfacing with CMSs such as Hubspot.

Hire Space’s mission is to make events a joy through transformational technology. As Front End Engineer, you’ll play a fundamental role in the “transformational” element of this mission, and help create a slick, fast, reliable and intuitive UI for the tools that we build - from our well-established marketplace to our new virtual event products.

You will get the opportunity to make Front End decisions for projects that you are working on, and will work closely with our Engineering Manager to develop coherent full-stack solutions, with our UI Designer to create designs that delight our users and with other engineers in the team for code review, sharing of best practice and other collaboration.
