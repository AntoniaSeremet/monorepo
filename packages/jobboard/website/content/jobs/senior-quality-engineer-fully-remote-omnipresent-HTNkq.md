## Description

Remote work is one of the great equalisers of our time, allowing people to secure employment opportunities from companies around the world, no matter where they were born or where they live.

Yet, at a time when remote work is exploding, most companies are finding it too complex, costly and time consuming to employ workers internationally. At Omnipresent, we’re centralising this complexity and providing our clients, and their remote workers, with a simplified, cost-effective and legally compliant employment experience. With a network of legal entities across the world, coupled with an automation-focused tech platform, we’re building the premier global employment-as-a-service offering on the market.

Omnipresent is looking for an experienced Quality Engineer who can help us continue building our customer and internal facing OmniPlatform at a high level of quality. This is not your typical testing role - we are looking for someone who can help guide overall quality for the team. That means helping engineers deliver well tested software, building a system that allows us to release value quickly and easily, and have confidence that when our tests pass the software is working.

The Role

In this role you will be joining a team of senior engineers, and working with them and the Head of Engineering to define and implement a system to ensure that Omnipresent is building and releasing high quality software. This role touches all phases of development, from solution definition through to release and production. We are not looking for a tester - we are looking for a system builder, collaborator, coach and automation specialist that can help us release quality software quickly.

From one day to the next you may be:

*   improving our CI/CD pipeline & test frameworks
*   coaching product engineers on how to test the feature they’re working on
*   talking to Product Management about the problems that need to be solved, or
*   working with the Head of Engineering to advance broader process initiatives

This role, reporting directly to the Head of Engineering, carries a lot of autonomy and will be key to shaping the future of Omnipresent engineering. We are looking for someone with outstanding communication skills, coaching ability and the ability to think about the system of software development, and how to tweak it to make it better.

## Requirements

You might be a good fit if:

*   You have at least 5 years of technology experience
*   You have worked in a quality/QA/SDET type role for at least 2 years in a web environment
*   You have experience with automated test frameworks, and in moving organizations up the Test Pyramid
*   You have a demonstrated ability to coach others, influence peers and gain buy-in for changes without authority

We would consider it a bonus if:

*   You have worked in an environment following the Modern Testing principles
*   You are familiar with fullstack Javascript applications and the testing ecosystem
*   You understand DevOps practices and the thinking behind them and recognize the role that Quality plays in DevOps. Even better if you’ve worked with automated release tooling like Circle CI, feature flags, and related technology

What else is in it for you?

*   Interesting work and complex challenges: Being part of the founding team means this is greenfield work. You’ll decide the future of the tech stack and be fundamental to our success.

*   Equipment and infrastructure: We give you a budget for all the equipment you need to work effectively wherever you are
*   Company retreats: We are planning biannual company-wide retreats post COVID, and well as socials and other team building activities
