## Description

**TL;DR**

**Why?**

With so many companies transitioning to remote work, what we offer is more relevant than ever, and we are growing fast! We need to ensure that we are getting the best service to our customers with the optimum benefits, so that they don’t have to.

**What?**

You will be directly shaping our core product, working with our wider product and operations teams in a remit outside that of a traditional HR team. We are setting up a menu of employee benefits across at least 80 countries, making sure we find great providers at the right price and continually benchmark local markets.

**Who?**

You have deep expertise in benefits in an international context and a strong builder mentality, incredible drive and can move at a rapid pace. You love to streamline and automate processes and are obsessed with getting the best packages for our platform.

**The detail**

**About Omnipresent**

Remote work is one of the great equalisers of our time, allowing people to secure employment opportunities from companies around the world, no matter where they were born or where they live.

Yet, at a time when remote work is exploding, most companies are finding it too complex, costly and time consuming to employ workers internationally. At Omnipresent, we’re centralising this complexity and providing our clients, and their remote workers, with a simplified, cost effective and legally compliant employment experience. With a network of legal entities across the world, coupled with an automation-focused tech platform, we’re building the premier global employment-as-a-service offering on the market.

**Your role**

You will be directly shaping our core product, working with our wider product and operations teams in a remit outside that of a traditional HR team. We need to set up a menu of employee benefits across at least 80 countries, making sure we find great providers at the right price and continually benchmark local markets. This is where your expertise comes in. You’re not just building structure for our own employees, you'll be responsible for building a fundamental part of our service and directly affect our growth strategy.

*   Advise founders in anything related to benefits as subject matter expert
*   Develop and roll out a global compensation and benefits strategy as we expand worldwide
*   Identify and liaise with benefits providers as we enter new territories
*   Develop a set of benefits packages for each country as we expand
*   Streamline and automate processes using modern tools wherever possible together with our tech team
*   An ability to advise on inter-jurisdiction HR compliance would be advantageous
*   Assist with internal employee and client employee onboarding
*   Build the foundation of what is to become the Omnipresent Compensation and Benefits Department
*   Assist operations and sales with ad hoc queries

**What’s in it for you (apart from the most fun and challenging ride of your life!)**

*   Shared ownership - Being a part of our journey means you will own a piece of Omnipresent
*   Annual vacation entitlement: 33 days including local holidays - although we’re not too prescriptive!
*   Equipment and infrastructure: We give you a budget for all the equipment you need to work effectively wherever you are
*   Company retreats: We are planning biannual company-wide retreats post COVID, and well as socials and other team building activities
*   Flexible working - Work from anywhere in the world - We don’t care where or when you work as long as the job gets done. We are genuinely as flexible as the work allows

_We believe remote working is a great equaliser and we practice what we preach. Inclusivity is fundamental to our mission and we are committed to conscious inclusion. We believe in the potential of everyone; regardless of race, religion or belief, ethnic origin, different physical ability, family structure, socio-economics, age, nationality or citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, or gender identity._
