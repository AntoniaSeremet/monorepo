## About Us

Maharishi Foundation International (MFI) is an incubator for new technologies and outreach opportunities for the worldwide Transcendental Meditation (TM) organization. Over the past 60 years, the Transcendental Meditation technique has been learned by more than 10 million people worldwide via personal instruction from tens of thousands of certified teachers. TM comes from the ancient Vedic tradition, which is also the source of Yoga and Ayurveda. The effectiveness of TM is validated by hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies and is increasingly being utilized by individuals, companies, NGO’s and governments to address the epidemic of stress and trauma faced by the world today (see, for example, David Lynch Foundation). MFI is a growing team of about 30 people distributed across American and European timezones, leveraging modern technology and management best practices to make TM more available to people everywhere.
