## About BMAT 

BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, Los Angeles, Milan, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, New York, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo, and Moscow - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.

##  Our Culture 

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

## Job Summary 

As part of the engineering team of the Digital business unit, your responsibilities will be to build, improve and scale the products that power one of the most complete music data processing systems in the world. We use agile values to improve our day to day performance. 

We are connected to more than 80 digital service providers such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, Deezer or Amazon. They provide us with digital sales reports (DSRs), which we parse, reconcile, match and translate into royalty statements, among others, in order to provide insight to our partners, the collective management organisations and publishers of the world. 

In addition, we also provide on-demand audio identification services that enable our partners to be in control of user-generated content (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud) and increase revenues and traceability from videos containing their music. 

Our digital distribution system has already processed 162.000 DSRs with 87 billion transactions from over 250 countries, and currently ingests 650 million online music transactions per month in a horizontally scalable architecture powered by Amazon Web Services. Our main development technology is Python along with some of its frameworks, such as Django and Flask. We also use Docker to speed up our developments and deployments. 

## Essential Duties & Responsibilities 

We are looking for a resourceful, action-driven and talented coder with strong interpersonal skills to help us with the evolution, maintenance and development that a system of this magnitude requires. 

As part of the engineering team, you will work side by side with the operations and business team in order to offer the best user experience to our clients and develop creative solutions to satisfy their needs. 

As a Lead Senior Software Engineer, you will work closely with the Service Lead and VP Digital and participate actively in all aspects of product strategy – from designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.

*   Experience with Linux. 

## It would be great if you also have: 

*   Basic knowledge of Docker. 
*   Frequently worked/developed/deployed on the cloud and in automated environments. 
*   Experience working with continuous integration. 
*   Experience with software design lifecycle and best practices (code reviews, testing). 
*   Experience designing and developing RESTful APIs. 

## What we offer: 

*   Full-time job. 
*   Full flexibility on working hours and home office (i.e. World Office). 
*   Free coffee, fruit and language classes. 
*   Free snacks, beers and jam sessions on Friday afternoons! 
*   Flexible compensation scheme which lets you choose benefits that suit your lifestyle. 
*   Becoming part of a young and international team based in Barcelona obsessed with bettering the music industry. 

Diverse perspectives bring drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.
