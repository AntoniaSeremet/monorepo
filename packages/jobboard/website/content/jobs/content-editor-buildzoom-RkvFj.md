BuildZoom has a team of remote writers who research and write content on a variety of topics related to the construction industry. 

We need an amazing writer to edit each post, which averages 3,000 words.

The articles are written by eager, talented writers, but in a country where English is a second language. We'll need you to fix grammar, improve writing, and verify/improve the research.

Pay is $40 per post edited. Your schedule is extremely flexible, but we expect the editor to dedicate at least 10-15 hours per week, or about 5 posts. You are welcome to take on as many additional posts per week as you’d like. 

There are opportunities to expand your role into other aspects of BuildZoom, including learning about product design, a/b testing, building conversion flows, SEO, setting up websites, and nearly everything else required to run a successful website.

If you are interested in the position, send in your CV and a long-form writing sample. If available, please also attach a piece you have edited (before editing and after).

**About BuildZoom**

BuildZoom is a better way to remodel and build. Every year, we help homeowners and commercial property owners complete $2 billion worth of construction projects.

BuildZoom was founded in 2013 and is now the fastest growing startup in the construction industry.

Remodeling & construction is a $1.4 trillion dollar industry in the United States, and accounts for about 8% of the GDP of planet Earth. Yet, the industry is plagued with problems: extremely low consumer satisfaction, cost disease, and constant project overruns. The housing crisis is affecting nearly every American, and the broken construction industry is the single biggest factor for high housing costs.

BuildZoom's marketplace approach brings contractors online, creates transparency, and rewards quality work. 

The other half of our strategy involves using data science to analyze nearly 200 million building permits, identifying the best contractors and matching them to appropriate work. Projects completed through BuildZoom are finished faster and with double the rate of consumer satisfaction.

We look for passionate and talented people who strive to be great. We embrace unconventional solutions to challenging problems and believe that people should have the flexibility and independence to be creative and experimental - provided effort is always applied with purpose. We take the time to step back, evaluate and understand our efforts so wins can be nurtured and losses turned into learnings. We believe the team comes before the individual because great challenges can only be met through collaboration.
