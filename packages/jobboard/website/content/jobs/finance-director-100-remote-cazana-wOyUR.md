## Job description

**About you**

You are an experienced FD, having worked with start-ups or scale-ups multiple times. You have experience working with a variety of start-up schemes (EMI options, EIS, Future Fund, R&D credits) and have gone through multiple start-up fundraising rounds while on the finance team.

You are at a point now in your current position where you have reached the ceiling or you are looking to replicate your previous successes. You are looking to join a fast-growing Series A startup heading up the finance function as the company goes through additional rounds of financing, international expansion, and an exit. You want to be a part of this. You gain tremendous satisfaction from looking back at a successful company knowing that you added value and played a big part in their success.

You are a team player looking to share your skills and knowledge within your team while lending your experience to other areas of the business interacting with the departmental leads. You are self-motivated, aren't afraid to take initiative, are curious. You are not afraid to take feedback or to listen to other people’s points of view.

This is an exciting time to join Cazana and if you have the right experience and drive, then you have a great opportunity to take that fresh new challenge with an ambitious and growing company.

Don't miss out, apply today!

**About us**

Using big data and predictive analytics, Cazana analyses millions of automotive transactions daily to assess the value and risk associated with every vehicle on the road, enabling more accurate valuation and pricing in vehicle purchasing and insuring. We aim to make the car market (across all its service lines) fairer through a wholesale modernisation in its approach to pricing.

Founded in 2013, we are disrupting an industry which has typically been associated with mistrust due to the lack of accurate data. We use innovative AI and data-science driven modelling in a sector that can feel dated and we have developed the industry’s first real-time retail-driven valuations. Our systems are used by insurers, dealerships, finance companies and manufacturers globally.

Our mission is to set the world standard in automotive data. We create a fairer market for all by embedding unique data and accurate insight into automotive businesses globally:

*   Fairer to insurers: Avoid fraud. Price every policy correctly
*   Fairer to policyholders: Pay the right premium. Have claims settled fairly and fast.
*   Fairer to the planet: Make electric vehicles and new fuel types accessible to all with accurate future values enabling finance and subscription business models
*   Fairer to lenders: Lend based on fact, not anecdotes to reduce risk.
*   Fairer to dealers: Stock the right vehicles. Achieve a fair price for them all.

**Role and responsibilities:**

*   Manage the company’s global corporate operating model, including budgeting, tracking performance to plan and P&L / cash forecasting
*   Drive the annual planning process, which results in the creation of the annual financial and strategic plan
*   Act as a Business Partner and Trusted Advisor to the CEO, COO and other executive and business unit leaders
*   Develop a comprehensive internal reporting package that includes key financial metrics, and multi-dimensional analysis across sectors, geographies (after our international expansion) and product lines
*   Provide ad hoc business and financial reporting and analysis as needed for strategic decision support
*   Oversee preparation of finance updates for Board and internal executive staff meetings
*   Support preparation of the consolidated monthly board package
*   Incorporate best practices in a continuous improvement mindset across all owned business/reporting processes and ensure systemic tools are being fully leveraged in order to increase efficiencies and reliance on system (versus manual) controls.
*   Manage internal operating plan and stretch plan.

**What do you get (remuneration & benefits)?**

*   Competitive base salary (disclosed at first stage screening)
*   All the equipment you need to get the job done
*   The ability to work where and when you want in order to get the job done (remote and flexible working welcome)
*   A central London office and meeting space to use when you need it
*   Access to free counselling, therapy and mental health support via [Spill](https://www.spill.chat/)
*   Access to free personal/ professional coaching via a trained internal coach
*   Cycle to work scheme
*   25 days holiday, all bank holidays off and any period of closure over Christmas also paid.
*   Learning and training supported
*   Ability to make your mark on a fast-growing start-up that is disrupting a huge (£34Bn annual) industry.

**The skills, attributes and experience you must have:**

*   5+ years of related FP&A experience, with increasing levels of responsibility and seniority
