## Description

We're looking for a fourth member to join our talented team to help us build a modern analysis tool for customer feedback.

You will be in charge of building the front-end part of the Product Feedback app along with Jan who's currently mostly working on back-end services. Ideally we'd like you to work on both the front-end and the back-end part of the app.

**Who are we?**

*   Quentin, who works on Product and Marketing
*   Jan, who works on Back-End Services and Architecture
*   Kim, who works on Marketing and Strategy

We're passionate about tech and have been working in startups for the past decade. We're **transparent, honest, and looking to have fun at work**.

[Product Feedback](https://www.productfeedback.com/) aims to be a powerful tool for Product Managers to help them understand user feedbacks, and take better product decisions.

Many months of research have led us to scratch our own itch: Product Managers and UX Researchers are struggling to unify and analyze the feedback they get from their users. That's why we have begun creating Product Feedback, a flexible product inspired by [Notion.so](http://Notion.so) which will allow product teams to store product insights and make them accessible to their whole team.

Product Feedback is a new project which is backed by great investors. This ensures us financial autonomy while we seek product-market-fit.

**The position**

We're looking for a full-stack engineer with **solid front-end skills** who's excited to join a project out of the starting blocks.

**What's our stack?**

*   **AWS** to run all of our services
*   **Terraform** to manage infrastructure
*   **Kubernetes** to handle services
*   **PostgreSQL** as our main database
*   **TypeScript** for most of the coding
*   **NestJS** with **Apollo GraphQL Server** for the backend
*   **React** with **Apollo GraphQL Client** for the frontend
*   **Storybook** to build our components
*   **GitHub** and **GitHub Actions** for development and CI/CD

## Requirements

**Your profile**

Product Feedback is a fresh new idea, and we're looking for a passionate and dedicated colleague with a startup mindset that's ready to adapt quickly. We're looking for someone that is genuinely:

*   Friendly
*   Curious
*   Ambitious
*   Experienced working in a start up and on a product
*   Experienced with **modern front-end technologies**
*   Familiar with best development practices such as **TDD** and **CI**
*   Highly sensitive to **UI** and **pixel-perfect** implementations

## Benefits

**What we offer?**

*   A great opportunity for you to grow fast and learn a lot
*   Work life balance
*   Competitive salary
*   Fully remote position
*   Paid coworking space
*   Latest productivity software like Notion, Linear, etc.
*   5 weeks of paid vacation per year
*   Travels to conferences
*   Company retreats in cool places ðŸ˜Ž
