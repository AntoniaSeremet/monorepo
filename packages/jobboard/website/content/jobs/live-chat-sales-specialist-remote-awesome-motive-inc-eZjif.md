## Purpose of Position

We‚Äôre pleased to be searching for the next member of our Growth Team: a Live Chat Sales Specialist. You‚Äôll help curious business owners understand how OptinMonster can help them grow their lists, leads and sales and to turn those conversations into sales. You are motivated by helping small businesses win, and win more often.¬†

## üí° Interested in applying?

üîç Please read/follow the next steps outlined in "How to Apply" at the bottom of this listing.

Attention to detail is one of our core values! This is your chance to stand out :)

## Reporting

The Live Chat Sales Specialist reports to the Growth Team Supervisor. This is a sales and marketing position, not a technical support role. Your primary KPIs will be the number and value of sales made and chat happiness.

Skills you'll need to succeed in this role:

*   You have demonstrated experience in a sales position where your performance was measured by the volume of sales you produced.
*   You understand that what seems easy to you might seem like a technical nightmare to a prospect and you won‚Äôt make them feel bad for feeling that way.
*   You will become an OptinMonster expert. You‚Äôll take initiative to use our existing resources and team to master it technically AND to understand the business use cases for it. After all, you can‚Äôt sell what you don‚Äôt know.
*   You are more marketing minded than you are technical, but it would be helpful if you already know some CSS/HTML. If you don‚Äôt, _it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker_ because you‚Äôll be willing to learn what it is. You aren‚Äôt intimidated by learning new things. 
*   You‚Äôve used a Content Management Software like WordPress, or another website software like Wix, SquareSpace, Shopify, etc‚Ä¶ OptinMonster is software for converting the traffic that comes to a website, so it will be helpful if you‚Äôve administered a website before.
*   You have used an email marketing platform or CRM like Constant Contact, MailChimp, Drip, ConvertKit or Hubspot in the past. That‚Äôs important since one of the primary uses of OptinMonster is to grow a company‚Äôs email list.
*   You can write and speak conversational English very well and are excellent at thoroughly explaining complicated things in a simple way. 
*   You type at least 55 words per minute with 95% accuracy. You‚Äôll be tested on this before we interview.
*   You are able to work between the hours of 3PM and 11PM ET. While our entire¬†Growth¬†team is distributed around the world, at this time we need further coverage at these times.

What you‚Äôll do as a Live Chat Sales Specialist:

*   During your first 3 months, you‚Äôll spend the majority of your time learning about OptinMonster so you can accurately answer questions about it. You‚Äôll also shadow our Senior Live Chat Specialists and start chatting with visitors directly.
*   After that, you‚Äôll spend 70-80% of your time chatting with visitors to our website via our chat software (LiveChatInc) and eventually, through Zoom if you feel like a live call could help close a sale.
*   With the rest of your time, you'll work on one small "rock" each quarter. A rock is a project that helps move us move closer to accomplishing our annual goals. You‚Äôll have input into what rocks you‚Äôre assigned.
*   You'll use a consultative selling approach to guide visitors through the decision to purchase OptinMonster.
*   When appropriate, you'll recommend upgrades, or cross-sell other AwesomeMotive products.
*   You‚Äôll participate in Growth Team meetings weekly. Your voice will genuinely inform the OptinMonster marketing plan and product roadmap, so it's important to share your thoughts. Your input will help us make sure we understand the questions visitors ask.
*   You‚Äôll help identify new product opportunities by listening for inquiries about features or solutions we don‚Äôt offer yet. It‚Äôs up to you to collect and thoroughly document feature requests so that you can most effectively represent our customers' goals when we review feature requests.
*   You‚Äôll also help beta test features yourself.
*   You‚Äôll use your natural curiosity to learn more about marketing and sales, and to grow your understanding of how businesses want to use OptinMonster. You'll freely share what you've learned with the rest of the team.
*   You‚Äôll redirect existing OptinMonster customers to Product Success or Billing with grace, helping to de-escalate any frustrations and reassure them that the proper team will handle their issue swiftly.
*   The hardest thing about this role is being able to control the conversation and turn it towards a sale, rather than simply answering the question the visitor asked.

You will use the following tools frequently. You will take it upon yourself to utilize our documentation and theirs to learn how to use them if you‚Äôre not already familiar with them. You‚Äôll ask for help quickly when you need help:

*   OptinMonster
*   LiveChatInc
*   Asana
*   Zoom
*   Gmail
*   GSuite
*   HelpScout
*   Screencasting software like Droplr or Zoom

Bonus points if you also have:

*   Experience working and communicating remotely.
*   Experience using OptinMonster or other similar tools.
*   Created your own website and content for it (even if it was just a hobby).
