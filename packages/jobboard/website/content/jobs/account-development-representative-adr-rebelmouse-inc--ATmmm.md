## Job description

## The Opportunity

RebelMouse is providing an exciting opportunity to individuals who love technology and are adept at translating product capabilities into solutions that solve problems for key stakeholders. You’ll engage these individuals, and then convey the right ideas, concepts, and synergies that bring new client opportunities to life. This is a chance to work closely with the Chief Strategy Officer and CEO to learn, collaborate, and grow tremendously.

We love people who bring value beyond their core expertise, who care about ideas and concepts, and who want their voice to be heard.

We want you to love scalable solutions and actively take part in the creative process of driving company growth.This is a full-time, remote-only position with competitive perks.

## Who We’re Looking For

The right candidate will be ready to efficiently engage in outbound sales efforts and spread the word about our amazing product. The chosen candidate should feel very comfortable making new connections via email and LinkedIn, as these are the primary ways you will generate new leads. If you are an excellent listener, assertive, persistent, and persuasive, and you’re not afraid of rejection from prospects, then we’d love to meet you.This is a position for someone who has a passion for learning, loves fast-paced work environments, thinks outside of the box instead of waiting for solutions to be handed to them, and continuously exceeds expectations.
