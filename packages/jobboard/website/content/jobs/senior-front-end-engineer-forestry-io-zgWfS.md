At Forestry.io, we believe the web is one of humanity’s greatest achievements and our mission is to help people build a better web. We’re building a Git-backed content management system (CMS) and an open source site-editing toolkit ([TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org/)), both focused on the JAMstack. [We’re a growing company](https://forestry.io/about) with big dreams that's full of opportunities for you to have an impact and grow with us.

We're looking for a Senior Front-end Engineer--with a React focus--to help us build TinaCMS. We believe Tina will be a game-changer for content management on the web, and you'll be at the heart of its development, evolving the technical architecture as well as building and supporting a healthy open-source community.

Because you are a product-minded developer, you easily connect the dots between our tech, the business and of course, our users. You are empathetic, thoughtful and a true team player, collaborating easily with your colleagues across the org. You love the fast pace of startups, the ownership that comes with being a part of a small team and are passionate about open source software and communities. If you're an optimistic self-starter who loves finding elegant solutions to hard problems, we want to hear from you!

## What You'll Do:

*   Contribute to the vision and roadmap of the open-source project
*   Architect and build the APIs that power the developers using Tina
*   Interface with and support our open-source community
*   Contribute to the writing of docs, RFCs, migration guides, blog posts in order to support our community

## Who You Are:

*   You’re a seasoned React developer with knowledge of advanced React patterns
*   You’ve worked on building APIs or libraries for other developers and understand the importance of a great DX
*   You have excellent communication skills both written and verbal
*   You enjoy digging deep and solving tough problems with code, as you’ll be building abstractions, refactoring and troubleshooting regularly
*   You're a highly effective collaborator, able to build great solutions with your peers at Forestry and with our open-source community
*   You have startup experience and enjoy the autonomy, entrepreneurialism and bias for execution

## Nice-To-Haves:

*   You have experience maintaining an open-source project
*   You have experience working with TypeScript or NextJS
*   You have a strong design sense & awareness
*   You have familiarity with content management systems and/or the JAMstack in general
