In this role, you'll be engaging directly with global and specialized consulting firms and system integrators as a primary point of contact for the SDF. You’ll be providing support on helping them understand the Stellar network, how they can bring their public and private sector clients onto the network, and what role the network can play in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) initiatives.  Most importantly, you will be growing the world of blockchain and supporting SDF’s mission of creating equitable access to the global financial system. 

## You will:

*   Work with the grants, community and marketing teams to support the launch and execution of new programs and initiatives for engaging with our global partners
*   Propose new ways in which the Foundation can provide systemic support and opportunities for this ecosystem and their clients.
*   Seek out and respond to -- or help consultants respond to -- RFPs for major public or private sector blockchain initiatives.
*   Find venues where Stellar should be represented in this ecosystem, and represent or organize representation.
*   Proactively publish landing pages and other material to educate the ecosystem on Stellar

## Qualifications:

*   You have 3+ years of experience working in business development and / or growing a business as a founder, especially in highly technical industries.
*   You have a deep understanding and experience in closing large complex enterprise-scale deals in the finance and/or fintech space internationally, ideally in emerging markets.
*   You have an engineering background and/or a strong technical grasp of blockchain technology
*   You’re willing to travel 25% of the time (of course, once it is safe to do so).
*   You have significant experience working with internal and external stakeholders within this ecosystem and/or in a reseller capacity to execute projects and/or business negotiations.
*   You thrive in an environment where you’re an active participant in cross-functional projects
*   You don’t shy away from doing the hard thing.  You love doing the hard thing.
*   You see projects through and over communicate outcomes.
*   You’re an exceptional writer and have excellent verbal communication skills.
*   You have a strong interest in cryptocurrency, blockchain, financial inclusion, and the Stellar network.
*   You thrive in a collaborative team environment with multiple stakeholders while having a high degree of accountability and autonomy.
*   You're flexible and comfortable working in a fast paced and dynamic environment.
*   You're curious and tenacious, with an infectiously positive attitude and an unwavering commitment to being successful.

## Bonus points if:
