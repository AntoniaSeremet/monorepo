You’ll work on projects like adjusting our routing rules to take into account local traffic regulations or incorporating unique data sources like popularity data to find the most scenic roads for every sport. Together you’ll build up a system to gather continuous feedback from our users and use these insights to validate changes in our routing algorithms.

**Ready for your next adventure?**

*   Translate your research results into structured routing requirements.
*   Work with experienced routing engineers to build a system of routing quality metrics to validate routing improvement hypotheses in a robust and data-driven way.
*   Work closely together with our data scientists and engineers on incorporating data sources like elevation data and popularity (heatmap) data.
*   Develop a long term routing strategy and manage the product roadmap to get there.
*   Work together with other product squads on large features where routing plays a key role.

**Why you’ll love it**

*   You’ll change the way people explore the outdoors worldwide and your work will result in millions of happy faces and countless adventures.
*   You’ll work on a product that you use yourself on a daily basis, seeing the direct impact of your work when you go for your next ride.
*   You’ll work on the cutting edge of routing technology bringing together engineering, data science & machine learning.
*   You’ll lead a high performing team of experienced routing engineers on a shared mission to provide the best possible routing for every sport type.
*   You’ll take ownership of your projects from day one, moving things forward, shaping the processes and choosing the tools you need to do your best work.
*   This is a remote role on a remote team where open feedback, new ways of working and thinking out of the box is not only encouraged but expected.
*   We let you work from wherever you want, be it a beach, the mountains, a co- working space (covered by us) or our headquarters in Potsdam. Anywhere that lies between the time zones UTC-1 and UTC+3.
*   You’ll become part of a diverse and international team and you will travel with us for team gatherings to amazing locations like Mallorca or the Bavarian Alps several times a year.
