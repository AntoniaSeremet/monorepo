**Design at Primer**

We design products that are remarkable - beautiful, intuitive, usable, useful, delightful. We are here to define new paradigms where millions of pieces of data can be consumed in just one page, through narrative and data stories.

The Primer Design team maintains a focus on simplicity and usability throughout our products. Users will be in awe of the complexity that lies beneath an easy-to-use, elegant interface. We are guided by our customers’ experience and aim to empower users with cutting edge tools that will accelerate their understanding of the world.

**The Experience Designer**

As a **UX Designer**, you will work collaboratively with product managers, designers, engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure a great user experience of our products. You will take a major role in ideation sessions, and it will be your job to translate complex ideas into easy-to-use responsive interfaces. You’ll be designing user flows, mockups and interactive  prototypes to effectively communicate ideas and product requirements; you’ll be working on multiple projects in parallel, while evolving a design system.

Our process is very iterative and agile, and we value the feedback loop. Our ideal candidate will be a strong critical thinker who is passionate and creative, but is also flexible and accustomed to frequent usability testing and iteration. Candidates should be self-organized, research driven, and eager to communicate with the team to fully understand how our products work. You must have a big picture focus, but also care about the details. At Primer, everyone likes to get their hands dirty - we are all problem solvers, eager to work together to identify design problems and work out intelligent solutions.

## Why we’re fun:

*   We have a collaborative environment with abundant cross-team interactions and learning
*   You’ll have the satisfaction of taking products and new features through from concept to their initial genesis to incorporation in a deployed product
*   We make products that help some of the world’s most influential organizations solve their highest impact problems

## Requirements:

*   3+ years of professional experience working in UX roles
*   Experience building products for multiple form factors
*   Ability to clearly and effectively communicate ideas with product managers, designers, and engineers
*   Interest in visual storytelling and data visualization
*   An understanding of HTML and CSS

## Expect to Do the Following:

*   Work with stakeholders on various design projects across the organization
*   Create multiple concepts and translate them to high fidelity designs and prototypes
*   Move fluidly between design tools, such as Figma and Adobe CC
*   Iterate based on user feedback and research
*   Contribute to the Design System
