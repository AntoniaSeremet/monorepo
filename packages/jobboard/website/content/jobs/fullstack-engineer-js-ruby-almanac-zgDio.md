## About Almanac

Almanac’s mission is help remote teams work more effectively with less meetings and faster consensus, all fuelled by the power of version control. We’re building GitHub for docs.

Besides being a streamlined realtime document editor, we are also bringing the insights of version control to document workflows so that people can quickly validate their ideas with the rest of their team and always know what state a document is in—no more vFinal\_1234. We know that the quicker people can get their thoughts down and get buy-in from teammates, the sooner they can get back to the deep work that makes a difference.

We’ve been moving fast since we founded Almanac in January 2019 and raised a $9M+ from leading Silicon Valley investors. That’s where you come in: we're looking for a full-time, full stack engineer with strong Javascript and Ruby experience to join our team of talented coders and creators.

## About the Role

We’re looking for ambitious, versatile engineer to join our small remote team.

## You have at least 3+ years experience working with a modern JS framework, ideally React. You also have **3+ years of BE experience with Ruby**, or a similar language and the confidence that you can be tackling Ruby tasks effectively within the first 30 days.

You can take an idea and come back with timelines, tradeoffs and a focus on getting V1 live sooner rather than later. You relish good communication and understand how important it is in a remote team. You know that we succeed or fail as a team. You thrive on regular feedback on how you can work more effectively.

You have a strong IC muscle that means you’re comfortable building full stack features from scratch. You write clean code that does just what it needs to, and nothing more. Ideally, you’ve worked in an early-stage startup environment before. You can move fast but also finish strong. You want to be challenged, week on week.

You know that your technical skills are a means to an end: delivering features for our users. You know the sequence is “make it work, make it right, make it fast”. You have opinions based on the products you’ve built throughout your career, but you’re not dogmatic on technology choices or precious about code. You always strive to make the complex simple.

You are excited to travel and hang out with us, gorging on Tartine croissants and sampling the culinary delights of wherever we travel for our next retreat. When we’re not together, we'll all kick back and play games together every week.

Bonus skills that will make you stand out: experience building document editors, knowing your OT from your CRDT, a zeal for version control, strong opinions about vim ("greatest editor ever to grace this planet" and "how do I quit?" are both considered)

## Our stack

*   Rails 5.2, Postgres 10.6, React, ProseMirror, AnyCable, Algolia, Heroku, Cypress
*   Team size: 11-50 people
