## About us

We're a friendly group of designers, developers, testers, and marketers having a great time building themes at ThemeIsle, sharing the best content at CodeinWP, and straight-up innovating with Optimole.

## Our mission

Make it easy for anyone in the world to launch & grow their online presence, through education, high-quality products, and reliable support.

## About the role

We’re looking for a WordPress Developer that will join the engineering team. You will help create new features, improve existing code, squash bugs and help us grow the themes and plugins from our portfolio.

## Requirements

Note: it is not required that you have all of these! Teams have varying needs, focuses, and use varying technologies.

*   BA/BS in Computer Science or equivalent
*   Minimum of 2+ years experience building WordPress plugins or themes
*   Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP
*   Understanding of responsive design and its implementation
*   Experience building and shipping production-ready applications
*   Extensive knowledge of the WordPress ecosystem
*   Ability to work in cross-functional teams
*   Good analytical and debugging skills
*   Unit/integration testing experience
*   Working knowledge of internationalization, localization, and/or accessibility
*   Write performance-focused and optimized code

## Who you are?

*   You’re independent, take initiative often, and come up with your own ideas. Being entirely responsible for a project – from start to finish – doesn't scare you.
*   You're a great communicator and have excellent levels of English, both spoken and written. In our company, communication is key.
*   You are curious and keen to learn new things. Developing new skills is one of your main goals.
*   You love to add value and get deeply involved in everything you're building. You always try to deliver the best possible product.
*   You enjoy working in a team and helping other developers.
*   You use feedback to improve yourself and do not see it as a personal criticism.    
*   You don't mind taking care of tasks of all sizes – from bug fixes to large features.
