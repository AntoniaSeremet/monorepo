About BlackthornWe have two native apps on the Salesforce AppExchange for managing Events and Payments. We’re a growing, distributed team in four countries. We move fast and have significant structure in our product build process. Everyone on our team has deep experience within their respective roles. Our customers span from 1 person companies to Fortune 500s.

## Why is our work important

Our apps continue to be easy to use and setup, due to continuous refinements with our UX. Most apps in our space take weeks to implement, ours take hours, and they work more flexibly, achieving significantly more functionality than our competitors. We believe enterprise apps should be as easy to use as consumer mobile apps.

What the job will bring you

We always try to use the latest features that Salesforce deploys (i.e. the metadata API, Lightning Flow components, etc.), write APIs to compound more advanced features, optimize how our processes operate across multiple packaged namespaces, and the opportunity to work with peers who each have massive Salesforce experience. This will give you the chance to continuously learn, be challenged, and deliver functionality to customers who crave it. Generally speaking, we deliver what’s most popularly requested to fill needs not filled by other apps in the marketplace, in a way that we think will provide the best UX.
