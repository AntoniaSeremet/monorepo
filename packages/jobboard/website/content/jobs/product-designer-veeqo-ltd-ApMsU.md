Product designer

The mission of this role is to take complex design challenges and translate them into highly engaging and delightful experiences to use on a day to day basis. As part of a small team of Product Designers, you’ll have the opportunity to make a real impact on the way we build product and promote the power of good design across the company and to our user base.

You’ll be translating user needs and business requirements into concrete ideas through the whole product development lifecycle - working collaboratively with other designers, product managers and engineers. This work will include user research, producing wireframes, low fidelity mock-ups to delivering beautiful high-fidelity visuals and interaction designs in a rapid-paced environment.

Currently, we’re working on a huge shakeup - a full product redesign with the introduction of a Design System and moving our frontend over to ReactJS. This is a really exciting time for Veeqo design - investing heavily into the product, we’re ready to hit the ground running when it comes to improving the quality and experience for our users.
