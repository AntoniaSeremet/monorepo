## Description

## At Vizibl, weâ€™re on a mission to help every company work together, better. We want to help all companies make a difference in the world by revolutionising the way they work together, empowering them to reach their full potential.

Are you interested in building products that challenge the status quo in the enterprise space? Do you enjoy an abundance of autonomy with just the right amount of alignment? Vizibl is looking for passionate software engineers who are excited about building beautiful solutions that solve complex problems. This is an opportunity to drive exciting new projects that will help change the way the worldâ€™s largest companies work with each other. The position is remote and is full-time.

We are looking for Junior Software engineers to join one of our product squads and work closely with more senior team members to design, build and ship scalable software solutions to support our product goals.

Weâ€™re looking for someone that has a real passion for growing within the industry. The right candidate is going to be someone that shows they are able to ask for support when they need it but also demonstrate that they can work effectively to solve problems on their own too.

As this is a fully remote position we'll be looking for strong communication skills and the ability to motivate yourself and your team to work independently.

If this sounds like your sort of challenge we'd love to hear from you.

ðŸ‘‹ **By the way....**

We wanted to make it super clear that having existing professional experience is not a requirement for this role. More important than existing job experience is your passion, mindset, aptitude and ability to learn

**Open to Everyone**
