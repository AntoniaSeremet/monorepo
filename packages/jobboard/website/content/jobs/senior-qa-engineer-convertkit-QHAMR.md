## Description

ConvertKit is delightful email marketing software built for creators. We help creators own their audience and turn fans into customers. For makers, authors, chefs, musicians, athletes, and anyone else making a living by creating the culture we all love, there isn’t a better tool for reaching inboxes. More importantly, there isn’t a team more committed to helping creators earn a living doing work that matters.

We’re on a mission to help creators earn $1B using our SaaS email marketing platform. We are 100% independent, 100% remote and are growing rapidly. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we’re looking for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our [mission, vision, and values](https://convertkit.com/mission) to join our team.

## The Role

ConvertKit has six engineering squads that cover our frontend, backend and infrastructure work. We’re seeking a Senior QA Engineer who can collaborate with each of our squads to improve cohesion in customers’ experience of our app; increase engineers’ confidence in shipping high-quality software - and decrease the time engineers need to gain that confidence.

To have a big, positive impact for our team and customers, the person in this role will take a holistic approach to quality. That will involve looking across our app to discern when tooling and automated testing can serve us best, and then set up the needed systems with our teams. It will also involve an ability to do nimble manual testing when it’s called for. In addition to having a deep QA toolkit, the person who will succeed in this role will have a dedicated orientation toward customer experience and strong communication skills for working with fellow team members.

While this is our first full-time QA role, we recognize that we're looking for somebody with an unusual ability to both lead QA and do the day-to-day work. We're also realistic about the ambitious scope of work and expect that collaboration on QA will help ensure the best possible customer experience.

**This role is remote - US and EMEA time zones preferred.**

## Your responsibilities

*   Create and share ownership of a regression test suite in collaboration with the Engineering squads
*   Design and execute manual test plans/cases and automated tests
*   Develop and influence testing processes for new and existing products
*   Lead the evolution of tests - i.e., test our tests - to improve them and serve shifting needs over time
*   Identify, thoroughly document, and track bugs
*   Teach key QA approaches, so that team members can contribute to our continuous improvement
*   Provide meaningful feedback on feature and technical designs from a QA and user experience perspective

## Requirements

**The right person**

*   Has significant experience in SaaS QA methodologies, tools and processes
*   Is avidly interested in using QA to continuously improve daily experiences for coworkers and customers. Cares about customer impact more than defect-free code
*   Can prioritize defects that need attention, and can discuss these priorities in the context of roadmaps and other tech debt
*   Is able to see across the app, and has an eye for detail
*   Is a very clear and proactive communicator. Able to work cross-functionally and help bake-in quality throughout the process, rather than serving as a gatekeeper at the end
*   Can balance leading on QA decisions and working collaboratively with teams
*   Is comfortable with tradeoffs and knows software will never work perfectly
*   Nice-to-haves: some experience with accessibility, performance and/or security testing - though these are also things you can learn on the job

## Benefits

ConvertKit has standardized salaries based on position, no matter where you live. For this role, we’re hiring at our level 3 ($130,000) or level 4 ($155,000), out of five levels for individual contributors in Engineering. Level is determined based on experience and our interview process.

**Other benefits include:**

*   3 weeks paid vacation, increasing to 4 weeks paid vacation after 1 year on the team
*   $1,000 yearly vacation bonus for taking 5 consecutive days of vacation, fully unplugged from work
*   10 paid holidays
*   2 weeks of sick leave per year, including mental health days
*   Up to 6 weeks paid bereavement leave, medical leave and natural disaster leave after 6 months of employment, 2 weeks of each paid leave in your first 6 months
*   Excellent medical, dental and vision benefits
*   12 weeks paid parental leave for primary caregivers, 10 weeks paid parental leave for secondary caregivers, with flexible scheduling in your child’s first year
*   Profit sharing
*   $3,200 equipment allowance for your first two years, $2,500 budget every following two years for U.S.-based team members
*   401k with a 4% match
*   Individual learning & development budget
*   Yearly conference credit
*   The team gathers twice a year for fantastic virtual or in-person retreats

## How To Apply

1.  A phone screen with someone on the hiring team
2.  A brief exercise or homework assignment to assess your skills
3.  A technical interview to discuss your technical knowledge
4.  A culture contribution interview

ConvertKit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.
