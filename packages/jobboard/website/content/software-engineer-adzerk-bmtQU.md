## We want engineers who are passionate about making the internet a better place.

Adzerk is a cloud-based service for building custom, ad serving solutions quickly and easily. We are looking for a talented Software Engineer with 3-5 years experience to join our growing Developer Experience & Integrations team!

What you’ll accomplish: 

*   Be the open source face of Adzerk writing open source tools, tutorials, how-tos, and articles that help our customers use our service to build the unique experiences their users require. 
*   Integrate Adzerk with well-known third-party tools like Segment, Zapier, Looker, etc.
*   Collaborate with product managers and designers to shape new features.
*   Work closely with our solutions architect and customer success teams to deliver value and drive growth.

Skills you’ll bring with you:

*   Experience designing & building front-end web user experiences

*   Experience with business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker, Crystal Reports, etc.)
*   Teaching in a classroom setting

You would be a member of an engineering team that values:

*   Constant improvement. If your processes have a way to improve themselves, you’ll never be stuck in a rut. We hold retros, and we value and protect the ability of any team member to say, “This can and should be better.” We value experimentation, especially when coupled with measurement.
*   Balance. We’re a collaborative team. We kick ideas around. The more viewpoints we have, the more likely we are to hear a good idea we haven’t thought of. We all have the opportunity to work on all parts of the system. No one is stuck working on the legacy systems full time.
*   Working to live, not living to work. We take our work seriously. We strive to make the best software we can for our clients. But we know that “release death marches” are not the way to achieve this. Software is a marathon, not a sprint. We work hard, but at a sustainable pace, and do better work as a result.
*   Autonomy. One of our core values as a company is, “We’re all adults.” We do code reviews and sometimes we pair program, but we trust each other. If you thought about the problem and have an opinion, your teammates will listen.
*   Mastery. Our CEO started out as a software engineer. Our VP of Engineering writes Clojure. We have an engineering team with decades of collective experience writing high-quality, fault-tolerant distributed systems. We love taking on and solving hard problems. We love learning.
*   A sense of purpose. We know what problem we’re trying to solve: to provide a first-rate ad serving platform to our global customers while continuing to evolve our product to meet the needs of the future.

## Why you’ll love working with us:

*   You will be part of an inclusive and collaborative team environment where all opinions and values are heard.
*   We are operate remotely. We are a fully distributed team across the US and UK.
*   You’ll receive world class benefits including:

*   100% company paid health, vision, and dental for you and your family.
*   Paid parental leave benefits (12 weeks paid maternity, 4 weeks paid paternity)

*   We embrace transparency and encourage you to read more about what we value through our [Company Constitution and Employee Bill of Rights](https://adzerk.com/blog/company-constitution/), our [About Adzerk](https://adzerk.com/about/) page, and [Careers Page](https://adzerk.com/careers/).
