## About Us

Maharishi Foundation International is made up of a small, distributed team with the thrilling task of leveraging modern technology to bring about growth and greater efficiency in the long standing, global Transcendental Meditation® organization. We have the great privilege to be able to innovate with considerable freedom while working closely with the leadership of the organization. Our flagship product is a mobile application for the international Transcendental Meditation® community. 

\*This is an incredible opportunity to be deeply involved in building and launching a product in a growing industry for a well established company with strong brand name recognition and an existing global community.\*

## Job Description

We are looking for a senior backend and devops developer with a proven track record of developing backend services and implementing devops pipelines using Amazon Web Services with tools such as CircleCI, bitrise and the Serverless framework. As we are a small, but growing team you will be responsible for the maintenance and support of existing backend features as well as planning and scoping new feature additions and iterations.

You will be working closely with our product team (design, product and development) to launch a meditation and lifestyle application. Applicants should have a proven track record working on large scale, consumer facing products with experience creating modular service based solutions. Applicants should be comfortable working in a fast paced environment, where each individual has a lot of influence and responsibility to deliver, and key to this continuous integration is a reliable and scalable CI / CD process.  You will play an extremely vital role in the development and release of this application as well as maintaining and improving the CI tools we use moving forward. Since there is an existing global community waiting for this application, the app will have an immediate, engaged user base.

Local development and stack deployment is managed using the Serverless framework, and CI pipelines have been implemented using CircleCI and Bitrise. You will become responsible for all of the working elements of the system and the accounts associated with the architecture.

## About You

You understand how the AWS suite of products is structured, and can show experience writing fully tested scalable code using relevant AWS products and services.
