In this role you’ll play a significant role in designing, building, and implementing innovative blockchain solutions for our ecosystem partners and you will lead the way in developing projects, from scoping & system design to development & best practice deployments. As a member of our team, you'll have the opportunity to work on a wide variety of problems focused on growing and scaling our global network.

*   Identify patterns in developer needs and design new protocols and services to increase developer velocity across our entire ecosystem.
*   Engage with our community of open source developers and partners on projects that encompass many different frameworks, languages, and ideas.
*   Collaborate with the team on code review and design, and contribute to best practices for all of engineering at SDF.
*   Investigate and refactor performance bottlenecks in order to continue scaling our API services.
*   Provide assistance and guidance for our integration projects with our partners and other organizations on the Stellar network.
*   Author detailed technical feature and protocol (RFC) specifications - we take design seriously, and we encourage everyone to be a part of our RFC processes.

## Qualifications:

*   You build software with your users and their needs top of mind
*   You're a true partner advocate
