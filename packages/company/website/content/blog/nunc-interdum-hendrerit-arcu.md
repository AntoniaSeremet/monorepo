Chatelaine (1930‚Äì1937) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After failing to win in her first seven races she was still a maiden when she recorded a 25/1 upset victory in the Epsom Oaks. She went on to win the Scarbrough Stakes and dead-heated for the Champion Stakes as well as finishing second in the Jockey Club Stakes and finishing third in the Coronation Cup. She was retired to become a broodmare but died in 1937 after producing only two foals, neither of which survived.
